What are you doing to try to find them?\n\nComment: @TalhaT\u00fcrko\u011flu: I'm not sure what the Nash equilibrium is. It seems like a strange notion.\n\nComment: @TalhaT\u00fcrko\u011flu: I think you need to read some introductory material on game theory to understand what you are trying to do. I think you should read this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium), for example.\n\nComment: @TalhaT\u00fcrko\u011flu: Try to write down the best response function for each player. What do you get?", "Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ denote the variables for the player's choice of rock, paper, and scissors, respectively.  The strategy set for each player is $S = \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nWe can begin by writing out the payoff matrix for this game.  In general, the payoff matrix for a game with $n$ players and $m$ strategies for each player is a $n \\times n$ matrix where the elements are the payoffs $a_{ij}$ for player $i$ when playing strategy $j$ against each of the other $n-1$ players.  The payoffs are zero when the choice of strategy is inadvisable (i.e., is dominated by the other choices).\n\nFor this game, we have $n=3$, so the payoff matrix is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix with six entries.  If we put the payoff matrix into a table, then we get the following.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l|l|l|l|l|l}\nx & y & z & x & y & z \\\\ \\hline\nx & y & z & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\ny & x & z & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\nz & y & x & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThe first row indicates the payoff to player 1 when playing $x$, $y$, or $z$ against player 2 playing $x$, $y$, or $z$.  The matrix is symmetric, so the entries in the first, third, and fifth rows can be filled out by symmetry, and the remaining entries are filled in from the fact that the payoff to player 2 is the reverse of the payoff to player 1.\n\nIn this game, the outcome is the same whether player 2 plays $x$ or $y$ against player 1 playing $z$, and the player with $x$ or $y$ is better off, so the entries on the second and fourth rows are redundant.  We can remove them from the matrix.\n\nThus, we get the following $2 \\times 2$ payoff matrix for this game.\n\n$$\\begin{array}{l|l|l}\nx & y & z \\\\ \\hline\nx & y & 1 \\\\\ny & x & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThis is a [two-person zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game).  We can use the [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) to find the equilibrium strategy.  If we consider just the payoff matrix, then the unique Nash equilibrium is for both players to choose the same strategy, $x$, which gives each player $x$ as their payoff.\n\nHowever, in this game, player 1's choice of strategy can be correlated with player 2's choice of strategy.  Thus, the strategies should be interpreted as a joint strategy for both players, which may consist of player 1 choosing either $x$ or $y$ and player 2 choosing either $x$ or $y$ (or $z$).\n\nThe only way in which player 2 can choose $x$ is if player 1 chooses $z$ (and vice versa).  Thus, the only joint strategies for player 1 and player 2 are $(x, z)$ and $(z, x)$, which give payoffs of 1 and 0, respectively.  The joint strategy $(x, x)$ is not a Nash equilibrium.\n\nComment: I have a question. Why the player can't choose $y$ and $z$? I think they can. I think the player 2 choose $y$ or $z$ (and vice versa) is not true. The players can choose $x$ and $y$ or $x$ and $z$ or $y$ and $z$.\n\nComment: @AliSeyedmajidi: I think you would need to ask your instructor or textbook to clarify that point.  It is generally true that the choice of strategy for each player is only correlated with the player's own choice of strategy (i.e., self-correlation) and not with the choice of strategy of the other player (non-correlation).  However, the game could have a more complex structure, in which the choice of strategy for each player is correlated with the other player's choice of", "\\strong{Hint}\n\nI believe you're looking for the [Nash equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) of the game.\n\nComment: I'm looking for equilibrium and I already know the nash.\n\nComment: The Nash equilibrium is the only equilibrium of the game.\n\nComment: @famfamfam: It's true that the Nash equilibrium is the only \"pure\" equilibrium of the game. However, there are many other \"mixed\" equilibria, which are equilibria that are not pure but are stable nevertheless.\n\nComment: @TimothyBuddell: Could you give me some examples of mixed equilibria?\n\nComment: @TimothyBuddell: I'd like to read more about mixed equilibria, could you give me some references?\n\nComment: @Petko: I'm sure there are many good texts that discuss mixed equilibria. The one I'm most familiar with is the book \"Game Theory and Applications\" by Michael Maschler, Shlomo Sagan, and Amir Yechiali. Chapter 10 of that book (page 276) discusses the mixed equilibrium.", "I assume that you have the payoffs matrix.\n\nIn the case of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, there is no equilibrium, since if all the players play Rock, then Rock is best and everyone will play Rock.  If all the players play Paper, then Paper is best and everyone will play Paper.  If everyone plays Scissors, then Scissors is best and everyone will play Scissors.  Thus, there is no equilibrium.\n\nAn equilibrium is a strategy for which nobody prefers to deviate and that nobody has incentive to deviate from.  In the case of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, since there is no equilibrium, everyone prefers to deviate from whatever strategy they are playing.  For example, if you are playing Rock, you will prefer to deviate to Paper (because then you will win), and if you are playing Paper, you will prefer to deviate to Scissors (because then you will win).  Thus, there is no equilibrium.\n\nComment: Thank you for answer", "I'd say you have a very interesting question. I'm sure you've seen this movie, which is a great introduction:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXM6sH4_41o\n\nYou'll see that in the Nash equilibrium the following plays should be adopted:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nPaper covers rock\n\n  Scissors cut paper\n\n  Rock crushes lizard\n\n  Lizard poisons Spock\n\n  Spock smashes scissors\n\n  Scissors decapitates lizard\n\n  Lizard eats paper\n\n  Paper disproves Spock\n\n  Spock vaporizes rock\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe reason for this is that the only way to win is to exploit the assumption that your opponent is behaving according to the Nash equilibrium. For example, if Spock plays scissors, I'll play paper and win. Therefore, if I want to win, I should play scissors, assuming that Spock plays paper.\n\nAnd so it goes on.\n\nYou should be able to solve this by yourself, but if you're stuck, you can try the following method:\n\nSuppose a player chooses \"Rock\". If his opponent chooses \"Paper\", he loses. If his opponent chooses \"Scissors\", he wins. Therefore the pay-off matrix is:\n\n\\begin{code}\n    Paper     Scissors\nRock    -1     1\n\\end{code}\n\nNow, suppose a player chooses \"Paper\". If his opponent chooses \"Scissors\", he wins.

I'm not sure how you'd get references from your neighbors or coworkers, but something from the community you're active in could be useful.

I would like to see a combined income of at least $60,000.\n\\item Credit score. I don't care if it is low but I would prefer it to be over 680.\n\\item References. I like to see 2 or 3 references.\n\\item Photos. I would like to see a family photo.\n\\item Pets. I would prefer no pets.\n\\item Smoking. I would prefer no smoking.\n\\item Cleaning. I look for cleaning references.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI would try to find a landlord who is more open to renting to immigrants like you. You may have to pay a bit more for the privilege.\n\nComment: I can't speak for other landlords, but I would not be any more open to renting to immigrants than renting to someone who was born in the US. The only thing I see that is different is that the immigrant might have a different credit history.

The landlord is probably reading through many applications, so you want to make sure that yours stands out as the best.\n\nI would start by saying something like \"I am writing to express my interest in applying for the rental of your property.\" Then go on to explain why you would be the best tenant for the property.\n\nBe sure to include your current address and phone number so that the landlord can contact you if they have any questions.\n\nFinally, end the letter by saying \"Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.\"\n\nComment: This is a very good answer, and I'm sure it will be very helpful to the OP. However, I think that it is also worth noting that this is not an answer to the question, as the OP is not in the US.\n\nComment: @JanusBahsJacquet - I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion.\n\nComment: He's a Middle Eastern immigrant (which is not the same as living in the Middle East), so it's not very unlikely that he's not in the US.\n\nComment: @JanusBahsJacquet - Ah, well, I misread the question then. I'll delete my answer then.\n\nComment: No, no, please don't! It's a good answer. And I was just trying to explain why I thought you might have misinterpreted the question.\n\nComment: @JanusBahsJacquet - I've edited my answer to reflect that the OP is not in the US.\n\nAnswer: I'm going to assume you're in America.\n\nYou might want to mention your immigrant status in your cover letter, if that relates to the landlord in any way (for instance, if they have ethnic preference). You might want to mention the exact area you're applying for, as the landlord might not have rentals available in your area.\n\nOtherwise, you might just want to mention your credentials, why you're interested in this particular house, and how you can be contacted.\n\nAnswer: First of all, I'd like to say that you should probably be applying for the rentals in the US through an agency.  I've only done it once and it was with an agency.  Just my opinion.\n\nAlso, if you don't have a job, then you're going to be at a disadvantage.  I'd recommend getting a job and then reapplying.  It's going to be difficult for you to get a rental without a job.\n\nAlso, I think you should just be honest about your situation.  I'm a white male that is an immigrant to the US.  I think you should say that you're a white male, and that you're an immigrant.  I don't think you should try to hide it.  I'm not sure, but I think it might actually be illegal to discriminate on the basis of race or immigrant status.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think it's illegal.\n\nAlso, I think you should just be honest about", "\\begin{blockquote}\nDear (Landlord's name),\n\nI'm very interested in renting your house.

But I don't know the landlord's name. In addition, I don't understand the part about being discriminated against because I'm a non-native English speaker.\n\nComment: I've updated my answer to address those points.\n\nComment: @M.H. You are being discriminated against because the person reading your application will not be able to understand you. He will assume you are not a native English speaker and that you will therefore be a less desirable tenant. This is a subtle way of saying, \"I'm not being discriminated against because of my ethnicity, I'm being discriminated against because I am a non-native English speaker and I don't speak English well.\"\n\nComment: I don't know that this is necessarily true. The landlord may be concerned that a non-native English speaker will not be able to read the lease and understand their rights and responsibilities, or will not be able to understand local emergency phone numbers or service providers.\n\nComment: @DarrenRinger I don't think that's a valid concern. The landlord can use the lease to explain what the tenant's rights are, what the tenant's responsibilities are and what the penalties are for breaking the lease. The landlord can also leave emergency phone numbers and instructions on how to contact the service providers in the house.\n\nComment: I think it's a valid concern, but not for a lease. The landlord may not want to rent to a non-native English speaker because they don't want to deal with the potential for translation issues when handling things such as maintenance issues.\n\nComment: @DarrenRinger I can understand that, but if the landlord has that concern, they can either find a tenant who speaks English well or use a translation service.\n\nComment: @DarrenRinger In any case, that concern is not why the landlord is discriminating against the OP.\n\nComment: @DarrenRinger If the landlord is concerned about translation issues, then the landlord should use a translation"]}

If you are trying to bring in \"tech bros\", I would talk about the ways in which they are underrepresented in the field. For example, the field of computer science is now dominated by Asians. If you want to have a more inclusive workforce, you need to be open to people of all races and ethnicities.\n\nComment: I think you're right about the history. I'm not sure about the inclusion though: I'd like to focus on women, but I don't want to alienate the men...\n\nComment: @DianaPapiz There are lots of reasons to include men. For example, in the field of computer science, there are many more men than women. If you include men, you can still be inclusive, but you can also show why it's important to have women in the field.\n\nComment: I'm not sure if you were around when I asked this question. I think what you're suggesting is a good idea though. I'll try doing something like that.", "I am a person who has been called a \"tech bro\" and I know many of them and I believe I understand the mentality. The crux of the matter is that tech bros have a very strong sense of entitlement. They believe that they are entitled to the best jobs, the best salaries, and the best working environment. They also believe that they are entitled to be the only ones in the room, doing the work.\n\nA tech bro would never admit that he has a bias against women or minorities. However, the tech bro has a perception that women and minorities are not as capable as he is. He believes that the only reason that they were hired, or promoted, is because of some sort of quota. He also believes that they are making his job harder by virtue of the fact that he has to work with them.\n\nTherefore, you need to write an essay that is full of statistics and factual information that proves that diversity is essential for innovation, productivity, and the bottom line. Your essay will have to demonstrate that diversity is not a quota, but a necessity for the best possible outcome.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer.

The aim of a policy paper is to convince the reader to adopt the writer's position or argument concerning a policy issue.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNote that a position paper is \\em{not} necessarily a \\em{report}, it is rather a short (but well-researched) argument.\n\nComment: +1 I really like the term (and concept) of a \"position paper\".

{"prompt": "What medicine should I take when I get a cold?", "response_list": ["It depends.  There are many different medications that are used to treat the symptoms of colds.  I'd recommend going to a doctor and having him/her prescribe something.  A doctor will know your medical history and can make a decision based on that.\n\nAnswer: Take one 500 mg tablet of acetaminophen every four hours.  It will help.\n\nComment: How does acetaminophen help with a cold?\n\nComment: Acetaminophen is a mild anti-inflammatory (or at least that's what it's sold as).  Inflammation is part of the cold.  It will not make the cold go away, but it will help you feel better.\n\nComment: You're right, it's not a cure, but it will help the symptoms.  Acetaminophen is in the Tylenol family of medicines, and has been sold for decades.  It's not a \"new\" medicine.\n\nComment: Well, you should say that in your answer.\n\nComment: I did.  I said it helps with the symptoms.  It does not cure the cold.\n\nAnswer: If your fever is above 38 degrees Celsius, you should take paracetamol.  If your fever is below 38 degrees Celsius, the symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, congestion, coughing, aching, etc) usually go away on their own and you don't need any medication at all.\n\nAnswer: If you have a fever take some acetaminophen (Tylenol) to bring down the fever. If you have a runny nose, you can take cold medicine, like Benadryl, but if you don't see any improvement, you'll want to go see a doctor.\n\nAnswer: Acetaminophen, like Tylenol, or ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin) will help lower your fever. There is an herbal cold/flu remedy called Theraflu, which is effective at relieving symptoms. Most of the time though, colds just go away on their own.", "Well, it depends.\n\nA cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, so it is not treated with antibiotics.

There are also a lot of shops and restaurants in the area.\n\nAfter that, walk to Yoyogi Park.  It's about a 10 minute walk.  Yoyogi Park is huge, and it's got a lot of trees and gardens.  There's also a zoo, a museum, and several baseball fields and tennis courts.\n\nAfter that, walk to Harajuku.  It's about a 20 minute walk.  Harajuku is sort of like what Shibuya is to Tokyo.  There are a lot of shops and restaurants in the area.  It's also the home of Japan's largest statue of Jizo, a Buddhist saint.\n\nIf you want to walk back to the Imperial Palace, it's about a 25 minute walk.  If you want to go back to the station, it's about a 10 minute walk from Harajuku.\n\nComment: Thank you very much. I hope I will have time to go to the places you mentioned.\n\nComment: I hope you have a great trip!", "I'd suggest the following itinerary:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Asakusa (Asakusa is a very popular tourist destination so it's recommended to visit early in the morning before the crowds come)\n\\item Tokyo Skytree (Take a Tobu Skytree Line train from Asakusa Station to Oshiage Station. Tokyo Skytree is located next to the station.)\n\\item Akihabara\n\\item Ueno Park (Ueno Park is not too far from Akihabara. You can walk there or take a train (Keihin-Tohoku Line).)\n\\item Tokyo Imperial Palace (Take a train to Tokyo Station and then take a train to Otemachi Station. Tokyo Imperial Palace is located near Otemachi Station.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf you have time, you can also visit:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Sumida River Fireworks Festival (It's held every year in mid-August)\n\\item Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observation Deck (Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observation Deck is located in Shinjuku. You can take a train to Shinjuku Station and then walk there.)\n\\item Yasukuni Shrine (It's also located in Shinjuku. You can take a train to Shinjuku Station and then walk there.)\n\\item Tokyo Tower (Take a train to Hamamatsucho Station and then walk there.)\n\\item Shibuya (Take a train to Shibuya Station)\n\\item Harajuku (Take a train to Harajuku Station)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAlso, if you have time, I'd recommend taking an organized tour. Tokyo's subway system is very complicated so it's hard to navigate your way around. I'd suggest taking a tour to places like Mount Fuji, Kamakura, and Yokohama.\n\nComment: I wouldn't recommend Harajuku, especially not for a day trip. It's very small and there's not much to do once you're done shopping. The same could be said for Shibuya.\n\nComment: @Dave I wouldn't recommend it as a day trip, but it's definitely worth visiting.\n\nComment: @Dave Yeah, Shibuya and Harajuku are probably not worth making a day trip to. It's definitely worth going to both places, but probably not on a day trip.\n\nComment: @Dave I've updated my answer with a few more places to visit.\n\nComment: The Sumida River Fireworks Festival is held on the last Saturday of July.\n\nComment: @FelixPalmen The annual Sumida River Fireworks Festival is held in mid-August. The dates are August 13 and 14, 2016. See the official website for more information: http://www.sumida-fireworks.jp/en/index_en.html\n\nComment: I think I have to go with Tokyo skytree and Tokyo imperial palace. Also I will try to cover as much places as I can.\n\nComment: @Dave Thank you for noticing that mistake. I've corrected it.\n\nComment: @user111902, I am arriving in Tokyo on 31st of July. Any idea on the timings of Yasukuni shrine and Tokyo tower?\n\nComment: @SaurabhSinha Yasukuni Shrine is open from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Tokyo Tower is open from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.\n\nComment: Please add that the Sumida River Fireworks Festival will take place on the 13th and 14th of August. The 15th is a Sunday (in 2016) so there is no fireworks on that day.\n\nComment: You can visit the Imperial Palace gardens only on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays\n\nComment: @Dave Thank you for pointing that out. I've updated the answer.\n\nAnswer: The top two things to see in Japan are Mount Fuji and the Shrines. These are in the suburbs, so the easiest way to do it is to get a one day rail pass. You can go to the 5th floor of the Tokyo station to get rail passes, and buy tickets to any of these places.\n\nAlso"]}

I'd like to see more innovation in search, especially in search results.  I'd like to see Bing start showing me more results that I'd call \"better\".  I'd also like to see Bing start doing more to make search more personalized.  And I'd like to see Bing start doing more to make search more fun.\n\nMost of all, I want to see Bing start thinking in terms of \"beating\" Google rather than playing catch-up to Google.  They need to start thinking about how they're going to \\em{beat} Google, not just how they're going to keep up with Google.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Innovate} - Bing needs to innovate in the search space. I am sure Microsoft has this covered and I am looking forward to their new search features.\n\\item \\strong{Integration} - Microsoft has a great suite of products, it needs to integrate search well into these products.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: Bing needs to start being used by more people.\n\nThe more people use it, the more information it will have, and the more it will be used.\n\nComment: You're right about this, and I've been using Bing for quite awhile, but the sad thing is that it needs to get to a critical mass of use before it will get to a critical mass of use. Microsoft has to get the ball rolling somehow.\n\nComment: It's a chicken and egg problem: people will use it only when it has more information, but it won't have more information until people start using it.\n\nComment: The only way to get mass adoption is to get people to try it, which Microsoft cannot really control.\n\nComment: The thing is, you can't get people to try it unless it has more information, and you can't get more information unless people are using it.", "I think Bing needs to get to the point where a search engine user can not tell the difference in results between Bing and Google.  Of course, once that happens, will the user care?  That's a different question entirely.  Google has a huge head start, but if they just keep adding more and more data sources, they'll get there.\n\nComment: I think they are getting to that point.  Google is doing more and more to filter out results that are not the best for your search term.  So, I think Bing has come pretty close to the point where I don't see the difference.\n\nAnswer: There are a number of things that Bing needs to do to beat Google, but first of all, as per your question, it needs to become more popular.\n\nThe problem is that there are a number of factors that make it a pretty steep hill to climb.\n\nFirst, Bing has done a good job of indexing more of the web, but many users still have Google as their default.\n\nSecond, many Google users are going to be reluctant to switch to Bing (even if the results are comparable - as per your question) because they already have their search history on Google, and they're not going to want to lose that.\n\nFinally, Google has a \"network effect\" that's hard to overcome.  A lot of people publish content specifically for Google, and if you're not on Google, you don't reach the audience that you want.  If lots of people are using Bing, and you're not on Bing, you won't reach those people either.\n\nAnd, I think that the above is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem.  It's hard to get people to use a search engine if they're not going to find the results they're looking for, but it's hard to get people to use a search engine if they're not going to find the results they're looking for.\n\nSo, for me, the big question is, can Bing overcome those challenges?  I think they can, but it's going to take a long time.\n\nComment: I would also like to point out that Google has a way better reputation than Bing. Google is known for their quality in search results, while Bing is still trying to get its name in the search engine market.\n\nComment: I think Bing is getting there.  The results I've gotten from Bing have been comparable to those from Google.  What I don't like about Bing is that it doesn't seem to have the same depth of coverage as Google.  It seems to give me similar results, but it misses a lot of the deep stuff that I can find with Google.  I'm not sure if that is because Bing's index is not as deep, or if it is because Bing is doing a better job filtering out the stuff that Google includes but I don't want.  But, I don't like that Bing seems to filter things out.\n\nComment: @Brian: I would agree, and I think that the fact that they have a better reputation is an advantage that they can leverage, but it's not going to be enough to overcome the other factors.\n\nComment: @Rick: Bing is doing a good job and they have come a long way. I think they can make it if they continue on this path.\n\nComment: @Rick: I think they are doing a good job, too.  I'm just not sure if they're doing well enough to overcome the network effect.  I'm not sure what the answer is.", "\\section{Not really an answer}\n\nI don't know about beating Google, but Microsoft's biggest advantage over Google might be that it has a more comprehensive business network.  It has a strong presence in the enterprise with Office and SharePoint and a strong presence in the consumer market with Xbox and Windows.  Microsoft also has a much more extensive network of Microsoft Certified Partners than Google does.  Google doesn't have a strong enough presence in business to be able to compete with Microsoft in that area.\n\nAnswer: \\section{Bing needs to be more relevant}\n\nBing needs to be more relevant to the searcher than Google. Google is currently doing a better job of this and the only way to change that is to have better results. That means that Bing needs to have a better search algorithm.\n\n\\section{The algorithm needs to be better at finding more relevant results}\n\nBing needs to be more relevant to the searcher than Google.

I have been living in the Netherlands for 15 years. I speak Dutch fluently but not a native level.\n\nDutch is an easy language to learn if you master the grammar. It has a very small vocabulary which means that you can learn many words by heart. And when you know the grammar, you can predict the meaning of new words.\n\nThe grammar is very regular. There are no irregularities. No exceptions. No silent letters. No word order. No gender. No case. No verb conjugation. No noun declension.\n\nThe sound structure is easy to master, too. The vowels are pure and the consonants are pronounced clearly.\n\nIt is a very pleasant language to listen to. There are no harsh sounds.

I'm here tonight to speak to you about an important issue. An issue that's been on my mind for a while. An issue that I can't seem to shake. So why not talk about it? Why not get it off my chest?

And I'll tell you: the crisis is that the state of California has very little electricity. And why is that? Because they don't have enough power plants. California has very little power plants. Now, I know what you're thinking: 'Why don't they build more power plants?' Well, you see, the problem is that the people in California don't want any more power plants. They're afraid that the power plants will pollute the air and make the state uninhabitable. And that's a legitimate concern. But what are they going to do? What are they going to do when the state runs out of power? Well, they can't do anything. They can't do anything because they're afraid to build more power plants. They're afraid to build more power plants because they're afraid the power plants will pollute the air and make the state uninhabitable. It's a vicious cycle.

How can I replace it with a captcha?", "response_list": ["You need to add a CAPTCHA if you want to allow anonymous access to your web-app.  Google Authentication is not anonymous, and will not allow access without a valid Google account.\n\nIf you want to limit access to a specific group, then you will have to create a custom CAPTCHA.  Depending on the type of app you are writing, this may be a simple `if` statement.", "You can use recaptcha in your google authentication, that way you can verify that a human is doing the google authentication. This is how I do it in my app. You can find out [more about it here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect)\n\nAnswer: I believe that this is not possible. If you're worried about spam, you can use a [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) (or Google's reCAPTCHA).", "If you want to add Google Captchas to your webpage, you can use the [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/intro) which is a free service by Google. There are two types of reCAPTCHAs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Invisible reCAPTCHA} - This replaces the visual CAPTCHA with an invisible one.\n\\item \\strong{Visible reCAPTCHA} - This is a normal CAPTCHA.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn order to use the invisible reCAPTCHA, you will need to add a few lines of code to your webpage:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<script src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js\" async defer></script>\n\n<script>\n    grecaptcha.ready(function() {\n        grecaptcha.execute('YOUR_RECAPTCHA_KEY_HERE', {action: 'homepage'}).then(function(token) {\n            document.getElementById('token-id').innerText = token;\n        });\n    });\n</script>\n\\end{code}\n\nTo use the visible reCAPTCHA, you will first need to create a reCAPTCHA account and obtain a reCAPTCHA key. You can then add the following code to your webpage:\n\n\\begin{code}\n<script src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js\" async defer></script>\n\n<script>\n    (function() {\n        var onloadCallback = function() {\n            grecaptcha.render('recaptcha-container', {\n                'sitekey' : 'YOUR_RECAPTCHA_KEY_HERE'\n            });\n        };\n        if (typeof window.onload === 'function') {\n            window.onload = onloadCallback;\n        } else {\n            window.onload = onloadCallback;\n        }\n    })();\n</script>\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: If you don't want to use a third party service like Google reCAPTCHA, you can implement a custom CAPTCHA using HTML and CSS. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n\\section{HTML}\n\n\\begin{code}\n<form action=\"#\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n\n  <input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\\end{code}\n\n\\section{CSS}\n\n\\begin{code}\nform {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\ninput {\n  margin: 0 0.5em;\n  padding: 0.2em 0.5em;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n\\section{JavaScript}\n\n\\begin{code}\nfunction validateInput(e) {\n  // Get the value of the first input field\n  const name = document.querySelector('input[name=\"name\"]').value;\n  // Get the value of the second input field\n  const email = document.querySelector('input[name=\"email\"]').value;\n  // Check if both fields are filled out correctly\n  if (!name || !email) {\n    alert('Please fill out all fields');\n    return false;\n  }\n  // If everything is fine, submit the form\n  e.preventDefault();\n  document.querySelector('form').submit();\n}\n\n// Listen for form submissions\ndocument.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', validateInput);\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{code}\nform {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\ninput {\n  margin: 0 0.5em;\n  padding: 0.2em 0.5em;\n}\n\\end{code}\n\n\\begin{code}\n<form action=\"#\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" placeholder=\"Name\">\n  <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\">\n\n  <input type=\"submit\">\n</form>\n\\end{code}\n\nThis", "You can add a simple script to your html that will check if the user is currently logged in with google, and if he's not, will force him to login.\n\n\\begin{code}\n<script>\n  if (window.gapi) {\n    window.gapi.auth.user.isSignedIn().then(function(signed_in) {\n      if (signed_in) {\n        //user is logged in\n      } else {\n        //force login from user\n      }\n    });\n  } else {\n    //load gapi.js\n  }\n</script>\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: Could you please explain a little bit more ?", "You can use recaptcha to confirm that the user is a human. To do this, you need to get the token that recaptcha will give you when you submit the form. There is also a google code snippet that you can embed into your website.\n\nIf you want to do the same in laravel, you can use the recaptcha package.\n\n[Here](https://packagist.org/packages/sot/captcha) is a link to the recaptcha package.\n\nComment: I have a laravel 5.6 application and I used the package but it gives me this error: `MethodNotAllowedHttpException in SotCaptchaController.php line 30:\n\nThe GET method is not supported for this route.

I think you need to use post request to access the create function.\n\nAnswer: In laravel you can use [recaptcha](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/recaptcha) package.\n\nIf you want to use google recaptcha for front end validation, you can use \\strong{javascript}.\n\n\\begin{code}\n  <script src=\"https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js\" async defer></script>\n\n    <div class=\"g-recaptcha\" data-sitekey=\"6LfB99YUAAAAAJyxH3R5zg0_0jQ2D30bG2YVeX4r\"></div>\n\\end{code}"]}

It's not clear whether the person needs a new pillow, or if he wants a recommendation for his current pillow. He asks for recommendations, but doesn't say why he wants them. This might be because he doesn't know why he wants them - in which case, he should ask for recommendations for finding out *why* he wants them. The OP can still ask for recommendations for finding out why he wants them, but that question is still vague and should be rewritten to be more specific about what he wants to know.\n\nComment: I agree that it is a bit vague. However, I don't see how this makes it a bad question.

It might be helpful to the OP to read up on pillows, but asking people here to recommend specific brands is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\n\nComment: @Erik: I didn't say it was a bad question. I said that it's not a good question. It's a question that I think is not useful.\n\nComment: Thanks for the replies. I'm still considering what I should say to him. I'm also considering just giving a link to a good review of pillows.\n\nComment: I think it's a good question, and while it might be a bit vague, I don't think it's too subjective.\n\nComment: @Erik: I'm open to changing my mind about this. I'm willing to admit that my answer is based on assumptions about the person asking the question. I would be happy if you edit the question and rewrite it so that it's clearer what the person is asking.\n\nComment: I'm not sure how to edit it. I don't want it to be too vague. I don't think it's too subjective. Also, I don't think it's too vague.\n\nComment: @Erik: I'm not sure what you want to do either. I think the question is bad, but I'm willing to change my mind if you can edit the question to make it better.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you want me to do. I think it's good.\n\nComment: @Erik: I don't think it's good. I think it's bad, and I don't think it's worth keeping on the site.\n\nComment: Then I disagree with you. It's an easy question to answer.\n\nComment: @Erik: That's why I think it's a bad question. It's a question where the answer is easy to give, and therefore not useful to anyone.\n\nAnswer: While there are many different types of pillows, the main thing to consider is whether your pillow is helping you sleep better.

{"prompt": "Can you explain dependency injection in C# like a gangster?", "response_list": ["We can define dependency injection a few different ways.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nDependency injection is a design pattern that looks up a dependency\n  (a service) in a container and then wires it to a dependency\n  (a client) that needs it.\n\nSimply put, dependency injection is the process of supplying a\n  dependency (a service) to a dependent object (a client) that needs\n  it.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe basic idea is that the client does not create the dependencies it needs. Instead, some other object provides the client with its dependencies.\n\nThis is the opposite of the \"new\" keyword; which creates an instance and returns it to the client.\n\nA dependency can be an object, a method, a property, or a class; but, when you create an instance, the dependency is usually an object.\n\nSo in C#, if we want to use dependency injection we use the `new` keyword, as usual, but we don't create the object we need. Instead, we give the client an interface that it can use to tell the container it needs something.\n\nFor example, a `Client` class that needs a `Service` might look like:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass Client\n{\n    public Client(Service service)\n    {\n        //...\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nThe client needs a service. When the client is created, it needs to pass an instance of `Service` to the client.\n\nSo we create the `Service` object and then pass it to the client:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar service = new Service();\nvar client = new Client(service);\n\\end{code}\n\nThe client is created, the service is passed to the client, and the client uses the service.\n\nWe can do the same thing with a container:\n\n\\begin{code}\nvar container = new Container();\nvar client = container.Resolve<Client>();\n\\end{code}\n\nThe container is created, the client is created, and the client uses the container.\n\nThis is dependency injection.\n\nIt's called inject because an object is injected into another object.\n\nIt's called dependency injection because the client is dependent on the service.\n\nComment: I like it.

It's not a black and white distinction between DI and non-DI.  The important part is not whether you use the `new` keyword or not, it's how you get your dependencies.\n\nThe essence of DI, in my opinion, is that you shouldn't do `new`ing when you need a dependency.  That's it.  That's the rule.  So if you're using `new` then you're not doing DI.  But that doesn't mean you have to use 3rd party DI frameworks to do DI.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a controller that uses a dependency.  This is the non-DI way:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass MyController\n{\n    public MyController()\n    {\n        this.myDependency = new MyDependency();\n    }\n\n    public MyDependency myDependency { get; private set; }\n\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        this.myDependency.DoSomething();\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nNow, let's say you're using a DI framework.  Instead of using `new`, you inject your dependency through the DI framework.  This is the DI way:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass MyController\n{\n    public MyController(MyDependency myDependency)\n    {\n        this.myDependency = myDependency;\n    }\n\n    public MyDependency myDependency { get; private set; }\n\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        this.myDependency.DoSomething();\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nNow, let's say you're not using a DI framework, but you really want to do DI.  There are a few ways you can do this.  One way is to make your controller a factory for the dependency:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass MyController\n{\n    public MyController(MyDependency myDependency)\n    {\n        this.myDependency = myDependency;\n    }\n\n    public MyDependency myDependency { get; private set; }\n\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        this.myDependency.DoSomething();\n    }\n\n    public IMyDependency GetMyDependency()\n    {\n        return new MyDependency();\n    }\n\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nAnother way is to use a singleton:\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass MyController\n{\n    private static IMyDependency _myDependency;\n\n    public MyController()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public MyDependency myDependency\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _myDependency;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void DoSomething()\n    {\n        this.myDependency.DoSomething();\n    }\n\n    public static IMyDependency GetMyDependency()\n    {\n        if (_myDependency == null)\n        {\n            _myDependency = new MyDependency();\n        }\n\n        return _myDependency;\n    }\n}\n\\end{code}\n\nNow, the DI framework way is not necessarily the best way.  But it's just one way of doing DI.  It's not the only way.  DI is about not using `new`, not about using `new` or about using 3rd party frameworks.\n\nSo I would say that the important thing is to use the dependency wherever you need it, \\strong{and} to not use `new` when you get it.  You can do the latter without the former.  You can do the former without the latter.  But you can't do the former \\em{without} the latter.\n\nComment: This is a great answer and it is the best I have seen on this topic.\n\nComment: This is the best explanation on DI I have ever found, thanks :D\n\nComment: This is the best explanation on DI I have ever found, thanks :)\n\nComment: The best explanation I've ever seen.\n\nComment: The best explanation I've ever seen.\n\nComment: I've been reading about DI for some time now, and I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but why is it that passing an instance of a dependency as a constructor parameter is not considered DI?\n\nComment: @B", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nCan you explain dependency injection in C# like a gangster?\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt's when you have a dependency.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"Dependency Injection, you can't get away from it\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"You don't need no dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you don't need no dependency injection, you don't need no dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\em{\"If you need dependency injection, you need dependency injection\"}\n\n    </blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: I'm not going to give you a +1 until you explain how to inject dependencies and why you might need to do it.\n\nComment: @SLaks: I would've thought that was obvious.\n\nComment: @SLaks:  I think the OP was looking for a joke answer, and this fits the bill.\n\nComment: @SLaks:  I suppose you're right.

This implies that the randomness associated with the initial weights of a neural network plays an important role in determining its ability to learn and generalize.\n\nThe LTH is based on the observation that deep neural networks are often able to learn complex tasks with surprisingly few parameters. For example, the VGG-16 network, which is used for image classification, contains over 130 million parameters, but is still able to achieve high accuracy on its task. This raises the question of whether there is a way to identify and extract the most important parameters from a neural network, without having to train the entire network from scratch.\n\nThe LTH suggests that this is indeed possible, and that a small substructure of weights in a neural network can be identified and extracted to achieve high accuracy on a given task. This is known as the lottery ticket phenomenon, where a small fraction of the weights in a randomly initialized neural network contains all the information needed to perform the task at hand, similar to winning the lottery.\n\nThe LTH provides insight into how deep learning works, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of randomness in the learning process. It also suggests that there may be ways to improve the efficiency of deep learning by identifying and extracting the most important weights in a neural network, rather than training the entire network from scratch.", "The paper is quite old, and their \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\" was later extended to the more general [Tailored Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02207) (TAS) model. I'll give a summary of both.\n\n\\section{The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis}\n\nThe paper begins by asking, \"What is the expected performance of the first layer of a randomly initialized deep neural network?\". Intuitively, we expect this to be very poor because the weights are initialized randomly. However, the paper shows that this is false.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIn fact, we find that the output of a single randomly initialized layer is often quite predictive, and can be nearly as accurate as a trained layer. This paradoxical phenomenon is known as the lottery ticket hypothesis.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is because the weights of a random neural network tend to fall into a number of regions of low loss, which are often connected. If you train the network from scratch, it is quite likely that the weights will randomly end up in one of these \"low loss\" regions and will have a low error.\n\nThese regions of low loss are called \"winning tickets\" or \"winning weights\" in the paper. The authors propose a new algorithm, called \"lottery ticket training\", which aims to find these \"winning weights\".\n\n\\section{Tailored Architecture Search}\n\nTAS, unlike LTH, searches for a complete neural network rather than a single layer. It works by first randomly initializing a neural network. Then, the weights are optimized to minimize the loss on the training data. However, the network is then \"frozen\". This means that the weights are fixed and no further training is performed.\n\nThe next step is to apply a number of different \"modifications\" to the network. These modifications can be things like adding/removing layers, changing the size of the layers, or changing the activation functions. The goal is to find a set of modifications that result in a network with low loss.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nOur modifications are inspired by a simple yet profound observation: the most successful modifications to a random network tend to be those that remove weights from the network, rather than those that add weights.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe authors show that this \"pruning\" technique can be used to find networks with low loss, and that these networks are often simpler than the original network.\n\nI hope this gives you a good idea of what the paper is about.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. Are there any papers that discuss the results of the lottery ticket hypothesis? I would like to know what the results of this experiment were.\n\nComment: @M.A.R.K. If I understand your question correctly, this is one of the papers that discusses results of the lottery ticket hypothesis. It was the paper that introduced the idea. The authors also wrote a follow up paper called \"Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: A Review\" which is a good overview of the research that has been done on the topic.", "The paper is about the [lottery ticket hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery_ticket_hypothesis). In short, this hypothesis is that training a neural network with a large number of parameters has a lot of sub-networks that are good at approximating a specific task. The problem is that it is very difficult to find these sub-networks, and the paper provides an algorithm for finding them.\n\nIn the paper, the authors describe the following experiment. They take the ImageNet dataset, and they train a neural network with 100 million parameters. This is a very large network, and the goal is to find a sub-network that is good at approximating the CIFAR-10 dataset which is a smaller dataset. They do this by using the weights of the 100 million parameter network to initialize a smaller network. Then they train this smaller network to get a good approximation of the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\nThe algorithm that they use to find the sub-network is called [gradient checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_checking). This algorithm works by checking the gradient of the loss function to find the parameters that are changing the most. Then it checks to see if these parameters are close to zero, and if so, it keeps the parameters and discards the rest. This process is repeated until the number of parameters is reduced to a small number.\n\nThe authors find that the algorithm is able to find a sub-network that can accurately predict the CIFAR-10 dataset with only a small number of parameters. They also show that this sub-network is more accurate than a fully connected network with the same number of parameters.\n\nThe paper is a good introduction to the lottery ticket hypothesis and the methods used to find sub-networks. It is a relatively short paper, and it is a good read for anyone interested in this topic."]}

Especially not at the same company.  They're not going to do it in the Bay Area.  They might do it in New York.  The Bay Area is not like any other place.  It's super competitive.  I was interviewing engineers at Facebook and Google last week and I was shocked at how many people were asking for $250,000 and more.  I would not be surprised if Google or Facebook gave you $250,000, but I would be shocked.\n\nComment: It's a pretty good offer, yes.  I was recently offered a job in New York at $80k.

In New York or Colorado, it's not hard to find a job for less than $80,000.  So it's really about what you're willing to live with.  I like the Bay Area and if you do too, then you have to accept that it's much more expensive to live here than it is in any other place.  I know this is going to sound crazy, but you have to think like a business owner.

It's possible that you can't afford to live in the Bay Area on $400,000.  It's just that there are lots of opportunities above $100,000, and not as many below.\n\nComment: Okay, so I think I'm starting to understand. In particular, it's a lot harder to find jobs in the Bay Area for under $100,000, so it's more expensive to live there. I'm also starting to realize that I'll be able to negotiate more if I'm getting multiple offers.\n\nComment: Yeah, I think you're getting it.  Also, if you're a student, then you'll likely be able to find a job for much less than what I'm talking about.  But you'll probably have a better chance at getting a job with a company that's not a FAANG.  You might also be able to get a job in a smaller city that has a lower cost of living.  That's why I say that you have to think like a business owner.  You have to think of what you're willing to live with.

Just a generic greeting that doesn't make any specific religious reference.\n\nAnswer: I'm not Christian and I send out Christmas cards.  If you know the people, you can send a card with a message saying something about how it's good to keep in touch.  You can also send a card without any message and sign it \"Happy Holidays\".  The family I live with are all Christians and they don't send out cards to non-Christians because they don't want them to feel uncomfortable.\n\nComment: This is a valid answer because it gives a personal opinion.  The other answers are more objective, but this adds a different perspective.  +1.\n\nComment: Thanks, but +1 is not possible for me due to my low rating.", "I think it would be a good idea.

If I wrote a card to a non-Jew, I would use a generic phrase like \"I hope you have a great time.\"", "I think you should get them a Christmas card, even if you don't celebrate Christmas.\n\nIn my opinion, a Christmas card is an inexpensive way to show your neighbors that you care about them and that you want to celebrate the season with them. It also helps them to see that you are thinking of them and that you are interested in their lives. I think it is a great idea to get them a Christmas card, and if you want to make it more personal, you can include a note with it.\n\nI would suggest that you write a note that says something like: \"Dear neighbors, Happy Holidays! I hope you are enjoying the season and getting everything you need. I wanted to take a moment to let you know that I am thinking of you and am praying for you. Have a great Christmas!\"\n\nI think that this is a great way to show your neighbors that you care about them and want to celebrate the season with them. It also shows that you are interested in their lives and want to know what is going on with them. I think it is a great idea to get them a Christmas card, and if you want to make it more personal, you can include a note with it.\n\nAnswer: You could get them a Christmas card with a personal note on the inside. Maybe something like: \"Happy Holidays! I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and New Year's! I'm so glad we live in such a great neighborhood!\"\n\nAnswer: I would get them a Christmas card. I would also get them a card that is specific to their religion if they are not Christian.\n\nAnswer: I think that you should get them a Christmas card with a personal message inside, maybe something like:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\"Merry Christmas!

When you know that the person is Christian, and that they are okay with religious greetings, then go ahead. But if you *don't* know, then don't assume that they'd be okay with it, especially if they celebrate Christmas.\n\nComment: I'm not saying that you're wrong, but I do think it's okay, for instance, to say \"Merry Christmas\" to a Christian co-worker. I'm sure that you wouldn't have a problem saying \"Happy Hanukkah\" to a Jewish friend.\n\nComment: I think it depends on how well you know them. If it's a co-worker you don't know very well, I'd avoid it.\n\nComment: I would say that the OP should use a non-religious greeting, but not because the neighbors are not Christian, but because the OP is not a Christian.\n\nComment: @JeffO: If you live somewhere where there is a significant Jewish population, you *can* say \"Happy Hanukkah\" to a Jewish friend, but it's not guaranteed to be correct.  I know several Jews who would be offended by that.  The right thing to do is probably to send them a generic \"Happy Holidays\".\n\nComment: I also disagree with the last part. Saying \"Merry Christmas\" is respectful of the majority of the population, and if you know they're Christian, then it's perfectly okay.\n\nComment: @JeffO: I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm disagreeing with the OP. I think it's okay to say \"Merry Christmas\" to a Christian friend, and I would say it to them, but I wouldn't say it to a friend of another faith.\n\nComment: @JeffO: I've been corrected, and I was wrong. I've edited my answer to reflect that.\n\nComment: I'm not sure I'd say \"Merry Christmas\" to a Christian friend. It's a bit presumptuous. I'd say \"Merry Christmas\" to my Christian relatives, though. I'm not sure if that's the same thing.\n\nAnswer: It's important that you are respectful of other people's religious beliefs.  If you're not sure at all what your neighbors' beliefs are, or whether they would be offended by a religious greeting, I'd say it's best not to chance it.  It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nI'm not saying that you should never say \"Merry Christmas\".  It's fine to say it to a friend, a relative, a co-worker, whoever, if you know they'll appreciate it.  But if you don't know for sure, it's best to err on the side of caution and use a more general holiday greeting, like \"Happy Holidays\".\n\nComment: +1. I would add that if you know they would appreciate it, and you are sure that you are using the right greeting, then it is perfectly acceptable. But for the OP, the safest thing to do would be to stick to \"Happy Holidays\".\n\nComment: @JeffO:  I agree, but I didn't want to make it sound like I was telling the OP that he should never say \"Merry Christmas\".

(I don't like being patronised.)\n\nAnswer: I'm not Jewish, but I'm not sure I would want to receive a Christmas card from a non-Christian.  I think it would seem kind of out of place.  I'm not sure it would be offensive, but it would definitely be weird.\n\nAnswer: You can send a card that says \"Happy Holidays\" along with an explanatory note saying that you're not celebrating Christmas.\n\nComment: I think that's a good idea.\n\nAnswer: If you're on friendly terms with your neighbors, then a Christmas card would seem perfectly fine.\n\nIf you aren't on friendly terms, and you don't celebrate Christmas, then a generic, non-denominational card would be appropriate."]}

The South of France spans from the Italian border in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west. It also spans from the Alps in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. This is a large area, and it is impossible to see everything in 10 days.\n\nThe first step is to decide where you want to go. The South of France contains many many attractions and places.\n\nIf you are not interested in driving long distances each day, it is probably best to plan a trip that is centered around some region. For example, you could visit Provence and Languedoc, which is where I live.\n\nThe next step is to pick a base. This is the town where you are staying. It is the place where you are going to spend the night. Every day you are going to leave from the base and explore the area.\n\nFor example, if you want to visit Provence and Languedoc, then you could pick a base in Aix-en-Provence, which is in Provence, or Carcassonne, which is in Languedoc.\n\nI suggest that you make a list of places that you want to visit in the South of France. I suggest that you make a list of at least 5 places. Then you can pick 3 of these places and make that the destination of your trip.

It is basically a discipline to train yourself to not think of anything, and to just experience the present moment.\n\nAs you mentioned, just taking a break from work is not enough. Your mind is thinking of work even during your break. Mindfulness is a training to teach your mind to not think, so you can just exist in the present moment.\n\nIt is not easy to achieve mindfulness, but it does work.\n\nI have been practicing it for a while, and I have had good results.\n\nReading a book about mindfulness may be a good start.\n\nComment: Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check it out.\n\nComment: I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but I'm wondering if you could give me some examples of how to be more mindful?

Does it work better to just be mindful during a work break, or is it more effective to be mindful throughout the day?\n\nComment: Mindfulness is about being mindful of everything you do.  If you are not mindful, you will end up doing things without thinking.  For example, try using chopsticks or a spoon to eat food.  When you use your hand to eat, you just grab the food and shovel it in your mouth without thinking.  But if you use chopsticks or a spoon, you have to think about how to use it and how to place the food in your mouth.  This teaches you to be mindful and to think about what you do.  It is the same thing for work.

{"prompt": "Why do my fiddle fig leaves look yellow?", "response_list": ["The leaves are turning yellow due to over watering. The plant is getting too much water.\n\nComment: Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure if it's over watering because I'm watering about every 2 weeks and I've had a water meter in the soil for the last few months to measure the soil moisture. I'll continue to monitor this.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, I've seen in multiple places where people are over watering their plants because they follow what the meter says. The problem is that the meter is telling you the moisture content of the soil, not how much water is in the soil. For example, if your soil is 50% moisture, the meter will tell you that, but that doesn't mean you need to water. It also doesn't mean that if you add 50ml of water that it's all going to be absorbed by the soil. The soil is not a sponge that will absorb water. It's just an indication of how moist the soil is.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, the best way to check for over watering is just to take the plant out of the pot, look at the roots to see if they are brown or black. If they are brown, the plant is over watered. See this link for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKw9zc6D4Gk\n\nComment: Thanks for the reply. I'll check the roots and update this question. I've had this plant for over 6 years and it's never done this before.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, the video I posted is from my own plant. The video is from 2 weeks ago. The plant was over watered for a few months and the leaves were yellowing and a few of them had started to drop. I'm trying to get it back to health.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, I checked the roots and they are brown, so the plant is definitely over watered.\n\nComment: Thanks for the update. I'll remove the plant from the soil and inspect the roots.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, the roots should be white or pale brown.

I'll repot it with new soil.\n\nComment: @mattp125296, it might be the soil, but if you repot it, you need to check the soil before you water the plant again.\n\nComment: I've repotted the plant and I'll have to wait a few weeks to see if the leaves turn green again.

Fiddle figs are pretty drought-tolerant, so they don't need to be watered very often.  If you're watering them too much, the roots will start to rot and the leaves will turn yellow.\n\\item Your plant is getting too much fertilizer.  Fiddle figs don't need a lot of fertilizer, so you should only fertilize them once a month at most.

For example, if you search #TeachingChildrenToRead or #Ages3-4 you will find people's tweets that use that keyword. The # symbol in front of the keyword makes it into a hashtag. It is used to search for keywords, and to make posts easier to find. So for example, if you are searching for a post similar to yours to see how it is written, the hashtag will make it easier to find.\n\nComment: @user3302199 you can also do #TeachingChildrenToRead #Ages3-4 to show that it is two keywords.\n\nComment: Thank you so much, this really helps!\n\nComment: @user3302199: You're welcome.

{"prompt": "I work with a colleague who seems to escalate things up the management chain every time things don't go his way. As a result I am no longer feeling very excited about working with him. This is a pretty important project for my career, though. What should I do? ", "response_list": ["You can't really change someone's personality, but you can change how you interact with them.\n\nHere's my suggestion:\n\n\\strong{When he asks you a question, just reply with \"I don't know\".}\n\nIf he keeps asking you for the answer, keep saying \"I don't know\".\n\nIf he tries to argue with you, just smile and say \"I don't know\".\n\nHe will eventually get the hint and stop bugging you for answers.\n\nAnswer: I think you have to work with him on a daily basis, so just ignore his \"escalation\", and answer his questions when he asks you.\n\nAnswer: Sounds like he's a micromanager.  I'd suggest that you either (a) escalate it up to your supervisor or (b) work with him to resolve it.\n\nI'd suggest that you escalate it if the micromanaging is affecting your performance or the performance of the team.\n\nI'd suggest that you work with him if you're concerned about your career.  You can point out that his \"escalation\" is affecting your morale and the morale of the team.  You can then work with him to minimize the impact.  For example, you could propose that you'll only escalate the \"escalation\" if he doesn't respond to your questions within a day.  Or you could propose that you'd only escalate the \"escalation\" if you have to escalate it more than twice per day.  Whatever you think would work best.\n\nIf the micromanaging is affecting your team's performance, then you might want to escalate it and have the supervisor deal with the micromanager.  If you do decide to escalate it, I'd suggest that you not mention his \"escalation\" unless the supervisor specifically asks you about it.  The supervisor will likely want to see the micromanager's performance reviews, which might tell him/her that the micromanager has a history of the \"escalation\" behavior.\n\nAnswer: You have to ask yourself what you really want.  Do you want to advance your career, or do you want to get along with your colleague.  It's possible that you might be able to do both, but you might have to be more patient.  What you do doesn't sound like a key project for your career.  I'd suggest that you stop letting him escalate things.  Answer his questions, provide status on your work, and ask for help when you need it.  If he escalates things, ask him to stop.\n\nAnswer: I think your question is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What to do about the micromanager's behaviour.\n\\item What to do about your work situation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThere are two ways to look at this.  One way is to try to change the micromanager.  This is not so easy to do.  You can try to reason with him, or work with him, but ultimately he is the one in charge of himself, his work and his behavior.\n\nThe second way is to change yourself.  You can try to change your attitude, or look for another job.  Of course, this is easier to do, but it will also take more time.\n\nI suggest that you try to change yourself, but at the same time, keep looking for another job.  Since you are not in charge of the micromanager, you can't change him unless he wants to change.\n\nIf you are a mature person, you can learn to take everything in stride.  Try to do your best to be a good team member, and a good employee.  Do your best to help the micromanager, even though he may not be appreciative.  Do your best to get along with everyone.  Try to be a good role model to your coworkers and to your micromanager.  If everyone is working together as a team, it might help to change the micromanager's behavior.\n\nIf you can't get along with the micromanager, then you may have to look for another job.", "\\section{Is it possible to change the way your colleague behaves?}\n\nYour colleague has been behaving like this for a while, so it is unlikely that you can change the way he behaves. But it is still worth trying. You can try to talk to him about it, and point out that he is hurting his own credibility by escalating things all the time. If you can do this in a kind and caring way, he might be receptive to the idea.\n\nIf he is not receptive, you can try to convince him that the project is more important than his ego. If you are both working towards the same goal, then you can try to get him to see that he will achieve more if he works more closely with you, than if he tries to work against you.\n\n\\section{If you can't change the way your colleague behaves, what should you do?}\n\nIf you can't change the way your colleague behaves, you should try to limit the damage he is doing. You can try to keep him away from the management chain as much as possible. This means that you should try to take over most of the communication with the management chain.\n\nYou can also try to build up your own credibility with the management chain. This way, if your colleague does escalate things, they will be more likely to listen to you.\n\n\\section{What if the project is more important than your career?}\n\nIf the project is more important than your career, then you should still try to limit the damage your colleague is doing. But you should also try to find another project to work on. This will allow you to learn new skills, and to build up your own credibility.\n\nComment: While I upvoted the answer, I would like to point out that the main question wasn't if the behaviour can be changed, but if it was possible to limit the damage.  I would argue that if it is possible to change, it is much better to do that, but if it isn't possible to change, then it is best to limit the damage.  In the end, the OP should also weigh their options and decide if they want to stay in the project or not.\n\nComment: @DarkCygnus: I agree that changing the behaviour is better, but it is not always possible to do so. So I think it is important to limit the damage if you can't change the behaviour.\n\nComment: I agree with that, I just wanted to point out that I felt like the main question was about limiting the damage, rather than changing the behaviour.  I think that the answer would be better if it had that as the main focus, instead of just as a side-effect of trying to change the behaviour.\n\nComment: @DarkCygnus: I think that limiting the damage is a side effect of trying to change the behaviour. If you can't change the behaviour, then you should try to limit the damage.\n\nAnswer: \\section{Is there any way to change your co-worker's behaviour?}\n\nAs the other answer mentioned, if it is possible, it is worth trying to change your co-worker's behaviour.\n\nThe best way to do this is to try to talk to them about it.

You should talk with him and try to solve the issue as a team.\n\n\\section{Don't talk about him to other people.}\n\nYou can't do it behind his back. That's a bad idea. It's unprofessional. It's also a bad idea because you're not going to get his side of the story.

Listen and be open to what he has to say. It's a good idea to talk about the problem as a team, not as two people against each other, and then you need to create a solution.\n\n\\section{What the solution might be}\n\nIt might be that he doesn't realize that what he's doing is actually disrespectful. You need to explain why he's doing that. It's a good idea to come up with a solution together, and have it be a solution that helps you both.\n\n\\section{What might happen if nothing changes}\n\nYou can report it to your bosses. But if you do that, you're going to have to be able to prove that you've been talking to him about it. Otherwise you're going to look like you're complaining about him and not trying to solve it. You need to be able to show that you've tried to solve the problem yourself.\n\nAnswer: I wouldn't do that. It's a project after all, and you have to work together.\n\nI'd talk to your boss and tell him about this. Boss can talk to the colleague and tell him to stop doing this.\n\nAnswer: I wouldn't directly talk to your boss but I would talk to your colleague about it.  I would say something like:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nHey dude. I'm worried that our relationship is not the best and I want to work with you. What can I do to help us work better together?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnd then listen.  If he is the problem, then you need to ask him why he is doing what he is doing and how you can help to improve the situation.\n\nIf he is not the problem, then you need to ask him how he thinks you can improve the situation and what he is doing to help.\n\nIf it is a very serious issue, then you might want to talk to your boss.\n\nJust my $0.02\n\nComment: This might work, but I don't think it's going to work for everyone.

I was just thinking that the OP might think that they can not choose how they react to things.\n\nComment: I agree that choosing the reaction you have to people is very important.  I'm not saying I disagree with your answer.  I just found the advice to talk to the co-worker interesting.  I've found that in many cases, it's better to just let someone cool off, then try to talk to them later.  But I'm sure there are many situations where this won't work.\n\nAnswer: This is a really common problem. I've worked with people where I've been glad to have them on my team because I knew they could do the work, but was disappointed by their personalities. I've also worked with people where I've been disappointed by their lack of knowledge, but glad for their personalities.\n\nIn the case where the person has skills you need, it's a question of working with them and either trying to improve the situation, or minimizing the impact of their behavior. This may mean asking the project manager to assign other tasks to this person, or it may mean talking to the person directly to see if they are willing to work with you.\n\nWhen I've had to work with someone like this in the past, I've found that it's best to keep my distance and not get too involved in their personal issues. It's easy to get caught up in the drama and start taking things personally, but I've found that it's better to keep the relationship strictly professional. This doesn't mean I ignore their behavior, but it does mean that I don't let their personal issues affect my work.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nAnswer: The question implies that this is a rather important project for you, and is likely to have a significant impact on your future as a programmer.\n\nIt's also implied that this person is more senior to you.\n\nIf your manager is not helping you, perhaps your manager is also not helping your coworker.  However, if this is the case, your manager is probably going to be even less helpful in your job search.\n\nIf this is the case, then perhaps you should start looking for a new job.  As they say, \"it's not you, it's them\".  If you can't work with them, and they can't work with you, perhaps it's best that you don't work with them.\n\nAnswer: If you are able to choose your team in the future, be sure to choose people who have the same work ethic as you and who you get along with.\n\nI've been in similar situations in the past, and I've found that the best thing to do is to keep your distance from them and not let their behavior affect your work. It's easy to get caught up in the drama and start taking things personally, but I've found that it's better to keep the relationship strictly professional. This doesn't mean that I ignore their behavior, but it does mean that I don't let their personal issues affect my work.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's not your responsibility to fix the situation.

If the OP is concerned about the boss finding out about the conversation with the colleague, I would suggest that the OP avoid telling the colleague that the OP talked to the boss about it.  And if the colleague does find out, then I'd say that the OP has more serious problems than the advice in this answer will help with.\n\nComment: @David: I agree, but I think it's also important to note that the OP may not want to escalate it, but can't control the actions of the colleague.

{"prompt": "Can you briefly explain this concept of computational irreducibility?", "response_list": ["Computational irreducibility means that the best way to learn from data is to minimize the risk, which is a function of a probability distribution.  A probability distribution is a measure of uncertainty, so when you minimize the risk, you are minimizing your uncertainty.  This is one way to minimize uncertainty:  you can also minimize the variance of your estimate, or minimize the expected value of your loss function.  But if you don't know what the distribution is, you can't do anything useful about the variance or expected value of the loss function, so that isn't going to help you.  The only thing you can do is to minimize your worst-case loss, which is what minimizing the risk gives you.\n\nBut there is a trade-off:  minimizing the worst-case risk makes for a harder problem.  So, for example, if I give you a function $f$ and ask you to minimize the risk of $f$, that's going to be a really hard problem.  But if you don't know anything about $f$, but just want to minimize the risk of some function $g$, then minimizing the risk of $g$ is easier.  So, for example, you could minimize the risk of $g(x) = x^2$ over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$, and that would have a simple solution of $g^*(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.  Minimizing the risk of $g(x) = (1 + x^2)^{-1}$ over the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$ is a harder problem, and in this case minimizing the risk gives you the tangent half-plane function $g^*(x) = 1/(1 + x^2)$.  But if you don't know anything about $g$, and you just want to minimize the risk of some function $g$ on the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$, then the problem is even easier:  it's just minimizing the risk of the constant function 0.  If you don't know anything about $g$, then all of the information that you have is that it's 0 on $[-1, 1]$.  So the \"worst-case risk\" of $g$ on the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$ is 0, and the \"best\" way to minimize the risk of $g$ is just to set $g^*(x) = 0$.  So, if you don't know anything about $g$, it's easier to minimize the risk of $g$ than to minimize the risk of $g^*$.  It's easier to minimize the risk of the constant function 0 than to minimize the risk of the tangent half-plane function.  So the tangent half-plane function is computationally irreducible.\n\nIrreducible functions are a special case of a more general concept that is called \"computationally intractable\".  The simplest example of a computationally intractable function is a \"random function\".  A random function is a function that can take on any value, and you don't know what the value is.  For example, if you ask me to minimize the risk of a random function, I might say \"OK, I'll take the risk of the function $g(x) = 0$ on the interval $x \\in [-1, 1]$,\" and then I would just set $g^*(x) = 0$.  But if you ask me to minimize the risk of a random function, I might say \"I don't know, I'll just set $g^*(x) = 0$.\"  So the problem of minimizing the risk of a random function is computationally intractable, because I don't know what the function is.  I have to minimize the risk of a random function, and there is no way to do that without knowing what the function is.\n\nSo, if you don't know what the function is, then you have to minimize the risk of a random function, and that's computationally intractable.  So, if you don't know what the function is, then minimizing the risk of the function is computationally intractable.  But if you don't know what the function is, then minimizing the risk of the function is computationally intractable.  So, if you don't know what the function is, then minimizing the risk of the function is computationally intractable.\n\nComment", "This is an excellent question. The usual example of a computational problem that is irreducible is the halting problem for a Turing machine.\n\nA Turing machine, $M$, is a finite state machine whose transition graph is a Turing graph. We assume that the Turing machine is deterministic, so that in each state, there is a single transition that can be taken. At each step, the machine can read in a symbol from the input tape, and it can read in a symbol from the output tape, the result of a previous step.\n\nThe halting problem for $M$ is to determine whether the Turing machine will ever halt. It is clearly undecidable, that is, there is no algorithm that can solve it.\n\nThe halting problem is undecidable because the problem is not algorithmically reducible to any other problem. I will give the intuition behind this, but I will not give a rigorous definition of \"algorithmically reducible\" because it's a bit complicated, and the intuition is a good place to start.\n\nThe intuition is that if you had a program that solved the halting problem, this program would be able to solve any other program-solving problem. For instance, you could have it solve the problem of whether a given program will ever enter a given state. This is a very powerful ability, and if you could actually solve the halting problem, you could solve any problem that could be reduced to a program-solving problem.\n\nFor instance, the halting problem could be reduced to a program-solving problem by giving a program that would halt if it ever entered a particular state. Since the halting problem is undecidable, this program could not be solved. Thus, the halting problem is not algorithmically reducible to a program-solving problem, and it is algorithmically irreducible.\n\nIn order to understand algorithmic reducibility, you have to understand the concept of a Turing reducibility. A Turing reducibility is a reduction of one Turing machine to another Turing machine. This is similar to the concept of a graph reducibility, which is a reduction of one graph to another graph.\n\nComment: I think you've missed the mark with this answer. There are a lot of problems that are undecidable, but not all of them are irreducible.\n\nComment: @Aleksandr: Could you give an example?\n\nComment: @AndrejBauer: The halting problem is not irreducible. The halting problem can be reduced to the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a Hamiltonian path. [See my answer for details.]\n\nComment: @AndrejBauer: Also, the decision problem for the language $L = \\{0^n1^n: n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is undecidable, but it can be reduced to the halting problem.\n\nComment: @Aleksandr: I am not sure I understand the first one. How do you reduce the halting problem to the Hamiltonicity problem? I cannot see the reduction.\n\nComment: @AndrejBauer: The reduction is called the \"Turing jump\" by Sipser. I think you can find it in his book.\n\nComment: @Aleksandr: I looked at the book. The Turing jump is not a reduction of the halting problem to the Hamiltonicity problem. It's a reduction of the *other way around*: it's a reduction of the Hamiltonicity problem to the halting problem.\n\nComment: @AndrejBauer: Yes, I guess you're right. I didn't fully realize that the original problem is to decide whether a given machine halts, not to decide whether a given Turing machine is computable.\n\nComment: @Aleksandr: I think it's obvious since a Turing machine is not a graph. Hence, you cannot directly reduce a graph to a Turing machine. But you can reduce a Turing machine to a graph.\n\nComment: @AndrejBauer: Yes, I agree. It's obviously not possible to reduce a graph to a Turing machine.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Definition:} A decision problem $P$ is \\strong{algorithmically reducible} to a decision problem $Q$ if there exists a decision procedure for $P$ that can be implemented as a decision procedure for $Q$.\n\n\\strong{Example:} The decision problem $P$ is algorithmically reducible to the decision problem $Q$ if $P$ can be reduced to $Q$.\n\n\\", "The basic idea is that in some cases, one can reduce the problem to the halting problem.\n\nWe can't do this for every problem, but there are some problems where we can.  For example, consider the problem of finding the shortest path in a graph.  This problem is known to be NP-complete.\n\nIf we assume the [hypothesis that P $\\neq$ NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem), then there's no way to efficiently compute the shortest path.  In fact, if we assume P = NP, then there should be a polynomial time algorithm for computing the shortest path.  But that algorithm could be used to solve other problems in P, and so we can't use it.  So it's impossible to find the shortest path in polynomial time.\n\nIn this case, it seems that we're stuck with an NP-complete problem.  But what about a different problem related to the shortest path problem?  The [travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is also NP-complete.  The problem is to find the shortest tour of a given city.  But we can't do that in polynomial time, either.  But imagine if we had an algorithm for finding the shortest tour of a given city.  We could use that algorithm to solve the [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) in polynomial time.  Using that algorithm, we can solve all problems in P.  So there's no way to find the shortest tour of a given city in polynomial time.\n\nThis is an example of a reduction.  In other words, the travelling salesman problem is [computationally irreducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_irreducibility) to the shortest path problem.  This means that neither problem is easier than the other.  So we can't solve the travelling salesman problem in polynomial time.\n\nIn general, a problem is computationally irreducible to another problem if there's no way to solve the first problem in polynomial time without also being able to solve the other problem in polynomial time.\n\nNote that we can do the opposite, too.  We can reduce the shortest path problem to the travelling salesman problem.  In fact, we can reduce any NP-complete problem to any other NP-complete problem.  So NP-complete problems are computationally reducible to each other.\n\nThe halting problem is a special case of this.  We can reduce the halting problem to any NP-complete problem.  But we can't reduce any NP-complete problem to the halting problem.  So the halting problem is not computationally reducible to any NP-complete problem.  However, it is computationally reducible to any other NP-complete problem.\n\nComment: Thank you for your response, it is very helpful. I have one follow up question if you don't mind. So if I understand correctly, the fact that we can't reduce one problem to the other, means that they are not computationally reducible to each other. Is this because the fact that we can't reduce one problem to the other, or is it because we can reduce any NP-complete problem to the halting problem (as you said)?\n\nComment: It's because we can't reduce one problem to the other.  If we could reduce one problem to the other, then the first problem would be computationally reducible to the other problem.\n\nComment: Ok, so if I understand correctly, we need to check if we can reduce one problem to the other, and if not, they are not computationally reducible to each other. Is that correct?\n\nComment: Yes.  The first problem is computationally reducible to the second problem if there's an algorithm for solving the first problem that can be used to solve the second problem.  The first problem is not computationally reducible to the second problem if there's no algorithm for solving the first problem that can be used to solve the second problem.\n\nComment: Thank you very much. So if I understand correctly, the fact that we can reduce any NP-complete problem to the halting problem means that we need to check if we can reduce any of the NP-complete problems to the halting problem, and if we can they are not computationally reducible to the halting problem, and if we", "A computationally irreducible function is a function which is hard to compute, in the sense that no algorithm can compute it.\n\nIn formal terms, the function $f$ is computable if there exists an algorithm which, given a number $x$, computes $f(x)$ in a finite amount of time.\n\nA function $f$ is called \\em{computationally irreducible} if it is not computable.\n\nA simple example of a computable function is the [Ackermann function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function).\n\nIt is a function which takes two argument, $x$ and $y$, and outputs $x^{y}$:\n$$\\begin{align}\nA(0,y) &= y\\\\\nA(x+1,y) &= A(x,A(x,y))\n\\end{align}$$\n\nThe function $A$ is computable, because you can use a loop to compute it.  In fact, you can compute it in linear time:\n$$A(x+1,y) = x + 1 + A(x,y)$$\n\nThe [Collatz function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is computationally irreducible.  It takes an integer $n$ and outputs its unique sequence of values $S_i$ such that $S_{i+1} = 3*S_i + 1$ or $S_{i+1} = S_i/2$ for all values of $i$.  It is not computable because there is no algorithm which can compute the sequence $S_i$ from the value of $n$.  You can prove that the Collatz function is irreducible by showing that it is not computable.  It can be proved this way:\n\nSuppose there is an algorithm which can compute the sequence $S_i$. We will show that this algorithm cannot exist.\n\nSuppose that the algorithm computes $S_i$ from $n$ in time $t$. Then, it will take at most $t$ time to compute $S_i$ from $S_{i+1}$.\n\nNow, the Collatz conjecture states that the sequence $S_i$ will always be finite.  We can prove this by induction.  If there exists a sequence of integers $S_i$ such that $S_{i+1} = 3*S_i + 1$ or $S_{i+1} = S_i/2$ for all values of $i$, then this sequence must be finite.  This is because at some point, $S_i$ must hit a cycle.  If $S_{i+1} = 3*S_i + 1$, then $S_{i+2} = 3*S_{i+1} + 1 = 3*3*S_i + 3 + 1 = 9*S_i + 4$.  So, $S_{i+2} = S_{i+1}$.  The same is true for $S_{i+1} = S_i/2$.  So, at some point, $S_{i+1} = S_{i+2}$.  This is a cycle.\n\nSo, we have proven that $S_i$ must be finite.  But then, it must take at most $t$ steps to compute $S_i$ from $S_{i+1}$.  But this is not true.  For example, if $S_i = 23456789$ and $S_{i+1} = 13456789$, then it will take $20$ steps to compute $S_i$ from $S_{i+1}$.  This is because $S_i = 23456789$ and $S_{i+1} = 13456789$ are not in the same cycle.  So, there cannot be an algorithm which can compute $S_i$ from $S_{i+1}$ in time $t$, and the Collatz conjecture is not computable.\n\nComment: Thanks a lot for your answer! I think I got the idea. Please let me know if I'm wrong: The Collatz function is not computable because there is no algorithm which can compute the sequence $S_i$ from the value of $n$. Can we also say that the Collatz function is not computable because there is no algorithm which can compute the sequence $S", "The notion of computational irreducibility was first introduced by Feynman in the context of the quantum theory of weak interactions. In the quantum theory, an interaction is irreducible in the sense that it does not break up in a way that would leave a part which can be described as a separate interaction. The concept of computational irreducibility was later introduced by Manin in the context of the computation of the fundamental group by the method of covering spaces. In this context, an irreducible theory is one in which the fundamental group cannot be computed as the (finite) fundamental group of a covering space. In the present context, a theory is irreducible if it does not decompose into a smaller, simpler theory.\n\nNote, however, that even if a theory is irreducible in this sense, there may still exist a simpler theory which is equivalent to it. For instance, the theory of nonlinear differential equations on a 4-manifold is irreducible, but it is also equivalent to the theory of linear differential equations.\n\nComment: I found this link to a paper by Feynman on quantum electrodynamics.

{"prompt": "Why do men earn more on average?", "response_list": ["I'll give a brief answer here, and expand a little on the question in an edit.\n\n\\strong{A brief answer:}\n\nThe biggest thing to note is that this is a big myth. Men do not make more than women in general.\n\nThe reason for this is that men and women are very different in their job choices. Men are more likely to go into jobs that pay more, and women are more likely to go into jobs that pay less.\n\nThis is a very well-known fact, and it's the reason for the so-called \"gender wage gap.\" This is the difference in pay between men and women across all jobs, regardless of what the job is.\n\n\\strong{Edit:}\n\nLet me expand a little on the question.\n\nThe biggest reason is that men are more likely to choose higher-paying jobs. Men are more likely to go into jobs that pay more, and women are more likely to go into jobs that pay less.\n\nWhy is this? Well, there are a lot of reasons.\n\nOne reason is that men are more likely to go into jobs that require more education. This is because men are more likely to have completed higher levels of education than women.\n\nAnother reason is that men are more likely to go into jobs that require more skill. This is because men are more likely to have higher levels of skill than women.\n\nFinally, men are more likely to go into jobs that require more risk. This is because men are more likely to be willing to take risks than women.\n\nSo, the biggest reason men earn more is that they are more likely to choose higher-paying jobs.\n\nComment: I feel like that's not really answering the question. It answers why there *is* a gender pay gap, but not why the gap is reversed in some fields.\n\nComment: If you look at the answer, I give three reasons why men are more likely to choose higher paying jobs. These are three reasons.\n\nComment: But there's no reason why those jobs would pay more _for men_ than for women.\n\nComment: The reason is because the jobs are more risky, require more skill, and require more education. For example, men are more likely to go into jobs that require more education. This is because men are more likely to have completed higher levels of education than women.\n\nComment: Is it?  This is a little bit of a misreading.  The question is specifically why women earn less in certain fields, not why women earn less on average.  There are a lot of fields where women earn more on average than men, for example.\n\nComment: Women tend to have different job choices. For example, women are more likely to work in jobs that pay less, and men are more likely to work in jobs that pay more. This is why women earn less.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: My question is not about gender-based job choices, but gender-based earnings. I didn't ask \"Why do women earn less on average\", I asked \"Why do men earn more on average\".\n\nComment: Because they have more education, more skills, and take more risks.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: That's the obvious answer, but the question is about why men earn more on average. Women tend to have less education, fewer skills, and less risk-taking behavior, but still earn more in some fields. The question is about the gender-based reasons for this.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: I added an edit to my answer. I hope it helps.\n\nComment: I think you've got the right idea.  I'll add an answer with sources, but I think what you've said is basically true.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: Thank you. I'm glad that I was able to help.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: I added an edit to my answer. I hope it helps.\n\nComment: Thank you for your edit. It seems to me that you've gotten the right idea.\n\nComment: @jamesqf: I'm glad that I was able to help.\n\nComment: My experience in the IT industry is that the gender pay gap starts early in a woman's career and is present in every job.  It disappears when a woman reaches a managerial position.\n\nComment: @Criggie: That's very true. The reason for this is that women are less likely to go into jobs that require more education, more skill, and more risk.\n\nComment", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nSorry if this question is too broad, but I'm really curious about this.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt is not too broad.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhy do men earn more on average?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe most basic answer is that women on average are less willing to work in certain professions, and that the professions with the higher salaries are the ones with a relatively small portion of female workers.\n\nOf course, there are a variety of reasons why women are less willing to work in certain professions. Sometimes it's because the jobs are physically demanding and dangerous. Sometimes it's because the jobs are not well-suited to having families. Sometimes it's because the jobs are not well-suited to having a social life. Sometimes it's because the jobs are not well-suited to having a reasonable work-life balance.\n\nComment: I think that is the answer.

There is no one single answer.  The research in this area is still in its infancy.\n\nAs others have noted, one likely contributing factor is the existence of the gender wage gap.  That is, women make less than men for similar jobs (all else equal).  This means that women have less to save so they may have less to invest (or simply invest less).\n\nAnother contributing factor is that women have on average 50% more college debt than men.  This means that women have less to save so they may have less to invest (or simply invest less).\n\nThere are also issues of risk perception and risk taking.  In general, women are less likely to take risks than men.  This means that women may have less to invest (or simply invest less) because they may be more risk averse and will try to save more.  This is consistent with the literature on gender and risk aversion.\n\nAnother factor is that women are more likely to be primary caregivers.  This makes it harder to invest in stocks.  This is consistent with the literature on gender and risk aversion.  A recent research study found that mothers who were the primary caregivers had less to invest in stocks than men and women who were not the primary caregivers.\n\nAnother factor is that women are more likely to be primary caregivers.

It is a family issue, an economic issue, and a civil rights issue. Equal pay is a key component of economic security, and it is a critical component of economic recovery. Equal pay for women would mean more than just an increase in women\u2019s earnings. The boost to women\u2019s earning power, along with the increased spending that would follow, would result in a surge of economic activity. It would mean more jobs, better jobs, and better benefits for all workers.\n\n\\strong{The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009}\n\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 was the first piece of legislation signed into law by President Obama. The Act overturns the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which limited the time during which employees can file claims for unequal pay.\n\nPrior to passage of the Ledbetter Act, employees had a six-month statute of limitations for filing claims under the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The Act extended the statute of limitations to 180 days from the date the employee first learned of the discriminatory pay.\n\n\\strong{Pay Equity Violations}\n\nThe NLRB does not enforce pay equity under the Equal Pay Act. It enforces pay equity violations under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) through the application of the Equal Pay Act to all employees covered by the NLRA.\n\nThe NLRA requires that employers\u2019 compensation policies and practices treat employees equally, regardless of membership in a union or other protected class status.\n\n\\strong{Equal pay is not just an issue for women. Men are also affected.}\n\nSometimes women are paid less than men when they are performing the same job, but equal pay is not just an issue for women. Men are also affected. For example, the NLRB has found that:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item A company paid male and female employees the same rates for the same jobs, but paid male employees more for jobs that were the same in every respect except that they were performed in the women\u2019s department.\n  \\item Male employees were paid more than female employees for the same jobs when the female employees were not unionized, and the male employees were unionized.\n  \\item Male employees were paid more than female employees when the female employees were members of a union that was different from the union of the male employees.\n  \\item Male employees were paid more than female employees when the female employees were members of a union that bargained on a nationwide, industry-wide basis, and the male employees were members of a union that bargained on a local basis.\n  \\item Male employees were paid more than female employees for the same jobs when the male employees were unionized, and the female employees were not.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Employers have a duty to provide equal pay for equal work.}\n\nThe NLRA requires that employers\u2019 compensation policies and practices treat employees equally, regardless of membership in a union or other protected class status.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act (EPA), which is incorporated into the NLRA, prohibits discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex. The EPA requires that men and women be paid equally for the same job in the same establishment.\n\nThe EPA also prohibits discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex when employees of one sex perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions.\n\nEqual pay is not the same as pay equity. Pay equity is the concept that men and women should be paid the same amount for the same work in the same locations.

But if you can cure all disease, and live indefinitely, then I think it would be a wonderful thing.  It would also be a completely different kind of society, where people are living for centuries instead of decades.\n\nComment: But in that case, people are more likely to be living in cities: they're better equipped to handle the density of population, and all the problems that go with it.\n\nComment: @Nick: Yup.  You could also add a housing technology that allows you to build a hundred-story skyscraper in an hour (and it doesn't cost anything).  Suddenly, the city is no longer a \"city\", it's a \"planet\".  Of course, you'll also get an endless stream of people wanting to live in the sky because they don't want to deal with the city below.\n\nComment: I think you need to be careful about the transportation technology.  If you can travel anywhere in an hour, why would you ever bother with a car?\n\nComment: @Nick: Well, the car is only really useful for short trips.  If you need to take a train, it's going to take you at least an hour.  In that case, why drive the car, when you can just jump on the train?  However, if you can get a train that goes 100,000 mph (or 100,000 kph, if you want), then you could make the train just as fast as the car.  But, even then, if you're going to be driving for an hour, wouldn't you rather be doing it in a car?  In fact, you probably wouldn't even be sitting down, you'd just be standing in a tube.\n\nComment: @Nick: Also, there are some types of transportation that you can't do with a car.  For example, if you're going to the moon, you're not going to be driving a car.  Of course, if you have a transportation device that lets you take a train to Mars, then you'll probably have a car there, too.  But, in that case, the car would be mostly a toy.\n\nComment: You'd need a way to travel outside the atmosphere, and there are only a few ways to do that.  Rocket, laser, ion plasma.

I think it could be very interesting to have a society that's spread across the galaxy, but then you're no longer talking about Earth.\n\nComment: @Nick: Yup, that's true.  Of course, there would still be a society on Earth.  It would just be a different kind of society.  The only reason to leave Earth is because it's easier to live there.  For example, you're never going to have to worry about space weather on Earth, because you're on the planet itself.  But, if you're living on Mars, you're going to have to deal with that.

You can create a world where death is no longer permanent, which would have the benefit of lowering the crime rate, and the problem of overpopulation.\n\nYou could also have a world where magic is as much a part of life as technology, so that the two are intertwined.\n\nComment: Magic: not a bad candidate.  I'd be more inclined to go with science/tech, though.\n\nAnswer: \\section{The Internet of Things}\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of devices and sensors that are connected to the internet, enabling them to send and receive data. This technology has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from healthcare and transportation to agriculture and energy management.\n\nOne of the main benefits of the IoT is its ability to provide real-time data and insights. This can be particularly useful in healthcare, where sensors can track vital signs and alert healthcare providers to potential problems before they become serious. In transportation, IoT devices can be used to monitor traffic patterns and optimize routes, reducing congestion and improving safety.\n\nAnother benefit of the IoT is its potential to improve efficiency. For example, in agriculture, sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture and nutrient levels, allowing farmers to optimize irrigation and fertilization practices. In energy management, IoT devices can be used to monitor energy usage and identify areas where savings can be made.\n\nHowever, the IoT also has some potential downsides. One concern is privacy, as the data collected by IoT devices can be used to create detailed profiles of individuals. There is also the potential for cybersecurity breaches, as IoT devices are often connected to the internet and can be vulnerable to hacking.\n\nOverall, the IoT has the potential to transform our world and bring about many positive changes. However, it is important to consider the potential risks and responsibly develop and implement this technology.\n\n\\section{Science and Magic}\n\nScience and magic have long been seen as opposing forces, with science based on physical laws and logic, and magic based on the supernatural and the magical. However, in recent years, the boundaries between science and magic have become increasingly blurred.\n\nOne example of this blurring is the growing use of quantum physics in magic. Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the behavior of subatomic particles, and it has been shown to have some interesting applications in the realm of magic. For example, some magicians have claimed to be able to use quantum mechanics to create effects such as teleportation and invisibility.\n\nAnother example of the blurring of science and magic is the use of technology in magic. With the advent of smartphones and other high-tech devices, magicians have been able to incorporate technology into their acts. For example, some magicians have developed apps that can be used to perform various tricks, such as levitation and mind reading.\n\nOverall, the blurring of science and magic is a reflection of the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of our world. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that the boundaries between science and magic will become even more blurred, and we may see even more unexpected and amazing applications of science in the realm of magic.\n\nComment: I'm not sure about the IoT.  I'm not sure I'd call it \"magic\", and it wouldn't really be a complete paradigm shift.  But I suppose it could be a \"magic\"-like extension of the current technological paradigm.\n\nAnswer: In the near future, there are several technologies that could have a significant impact on society. One such technology is artificial intelligence, which has the potential to automate many tasks and create new opportunities in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Another technology that could play a major role in the future is renewable energy, which could help address the problem of climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

Then change society to make it more interesting.\n\nComment: This is the answer that I was looking for.  Thanks for doing all the hard work.  As I was writing my question, I realized that I needed to do more research about what is happening now.  In particular, I need to look at what will change in the next 30 years.  As it turns out, that is an interesting topic in its own right.", "How about a technology that allows people to have the same experience as being in a physical environment?\n\nImagine, for example, having a holographic device that you can wear on your head to experience a real-time 3D simulation of a city, or a museum.\n\nThis would have the effect of people no longer needing to leave their houses because they can experience the world from home using this technology. You could even take it a step further by having people living in a digital world, with avatars that interact with each other, while their physical bodies are lying in bed underneath.\n\nThis would cause a massive shift in society, for example, the physical buildings in cities would become useless, since people could just have their holographic experience of the city. There would be no need for shops or offices anymore.\n\nThis is just the beginning of your story. How would your characters react to this new technology? What would be the consequences? Would it be a good or bad thing? Would there be a backlash against the new technology, or would everyone embrace it?\n\nComment: I was thinking about holographic projectors, but the problem is that they'd still be physically present in the real world, and all the problems we have now would still exist. But you did give me some good ideas!\n\nComment: Yes, that's true. But there could be other technologies that would allow people to exist in a virtual world, without having a physical presence. For example, if your brain could be connected to a computer, you could be living inside a virtual environment without needing a physical body. This would be similar to the concept of a \"matrix\" in \"The Matrix\" trilogy.\n\nComment: Could you elaborate a bit more on this concept? I'm not sure what you mean by \"your brain could be connected to a computer\" and \"living inside a virtual environment\".\n\nComment: I am thinking of a technology that allows people to have a virtual experience, without needing a physical body. For example, if you could connect your brain to a computer, you could have a virtual experience of being in a museum, or walking around a city, without needing to physically be there.\n\nComment: That's an interesting concept, and I've never heard of it before. But it sounds like it would be very difficult to achieve, and it would probably be impossible for me to describe in detail in the context of my story.\n\nComment: Yes, it would be a very complex technology.

Finding a \\strong{venues} is.\n\nThe first thing to note is that the US is different from India in that, the audience is not necessarily Indian. The typical audience would be a mix of people of Indian origin and non-Indians.\n\nAlso, the audience is somewhat educated. They are not just looking for \"beautiful costumes and a lot of song and dance\". They are looking for a \\strong{story}.\n\nAnd the story that the audience is looking for is usually a story that they are somewhat familiar with.\n\nFor example, I've seen multiple productions of \"Sita Swayamvar\". The audience is familiar with the story. It is a story that they can follow.\n\nOn the other hand, I've seen many Indian artists come to the US and perform \"Bharatmata\" or \"Vande Mataram\". The audience is not familiar with the story, and therefore, they just see beautiful costumes and music and dance and not much else.\n\nSo, what's the solution? Well, the solution is to find a story that the audience is familiar with and then create a production around that story.\n\nOnce you have a story, you need to find a venue.\n\nThe best way to find a venue is to find a theater company that is looking for a production to produce.\n\nIn New York City, you can find such theater companies through theater websites such as [New York Theater](http://www.newyorktheater.me/theaters.html).\n\nIn other cities, you can try websites such as [Stage 32](http://www.stage32.com/search/Theater).\n\nOnce you find a theater company, you can find a venue through them.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nComment: If you're in New York and looking to perform, you can also try contacting the Consulate General of India in New York at [consulate-ny@mea.gov.in](http://consulate-ny@mea.gov.in).", "I am a US citizen, but my father immigrated to the US from India in 1965, and is a professor of Indian music at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

I have performed in concerts at major universities, and in small art centers, and have also performed at festivals, such as the New York Indian Film Festival, and the South Asian Film Festival.\n\nIf you are in the New York City area, I would strongly recommend getting in touch with the New York Indian Film Festival, which is run by the Indo-American Arts Council.

{"prompt": "What are some good ideas for a startup in STEM education?", "response_list": ["There are already a lot of startups in STEM education - some in-person, some remote, some combining elements of both.\n\nOne of the challenges I've seen with STEM education is that it's hard to get a good group of students together to study a topic.  A lot of people just don't feel interested in the topic.  Maybe they think that science is boring or irrelevant.  So if you have a good way of gathering a group to study, you might have a good business idea.\n\nFor example, perhaps you can get a group of people together to work on a project.  For example, you could have a group of people work to build a rocket that could reach space.  Then they could compete in a competition with other groups of students.  Or maybe they could work on a project to build a robot to compete in a robotics competition.  Or maybe they could work on a project to design and build a new type of battery.  The possibilities are many.\n\nIf you can find a way to get a group of students together to work on a project that is interesting to them, you might have a good business idea.\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer!

I'm assuming you are trying to get students together to work on a project.  In that case, you might be able to get them together by offering them a prize or a competition.  For example, you might offer them a prize for the best project.  Or you might offer them a competition where they can compete against other teams.  If you can find a way to get them interested in the project, you might be able to get them to stick with it.", "The most common reason for failure in small companies is management.  The business model must be in place to support the idea, but the management structure must be sound.  You will need a solid business plan that covers all aspects of the business.  The business plan must be well thought out, detailed and must be followed.  You must have a strong management structure in place.  All of the individuals you choose to be part of the management team must have the same drive and desire to succeed.

I'd love to see some more details on how to go about doing these.  I think you hit on the key issue though, which is that you need to have a good idea.  Not just a good idea, but one that's marketable.  So the first step is to come up with an idea.\n\nComment: Thank you for your suggestion, but I wanted to know about other ideas.\n\nAnswer: I had a similar problem a few years ago. I've worked as a STEM teacher, and my bachelor is in maths, so the idea of starting a business in STEM education was very attractive to me. In the end, I started a business in another field, but with the skills I had developed from teaching, and I am more than content with it.\n\nWhat I've learned is that it's not easy to build a business in education. Educational services are highly regulated, and there are a lot of rules you need to be aware of. Your first step should be to find out what kind of business you're allowed to run.\n\nThere are three kinds of businesses that offer educational services:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item A company offering educational services.\n\\item A \\em{schools} offering educational services.\n\\item An \\em{institution} offering educational services.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nA company offering educational services is a company that has no interest in educating children or adults, but is interested in selling educational services. Examples are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The company that sells educational software at a good price, because it doesn't run a school.\n\\item Internet companies that offer online courses.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nA school offering educational services is a company that is primarily interested in educating children or adults, and that's the reason they are in business. Examples are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Private schools\n\\item Public schools\n\\item Universities, colleges and other kinds of higher education institutions\n\\item Educational agencies\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAn institution offering educational services is a company that is interested in educating children or adults, and running a school is a part of that interest. Examples are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The company that provides the school facilities, the teachers and everything else the school needs.\n\\item The company that provides educational materials.\n\\item The company that provides tutoring.\n\\item The company that provides online courses.\n\\item The company that does research.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe important thing about these businesses is that there are different rules that apply to them, and it's important that you know what kind of business you want to run.\n\nIf you want to run a business offering educational services, you need to look into the rules that apply to companies. For example, you need to know if you have to register your company in a certain way, and if you need to have a license to offer educational services.\n\nIf you want to run a school, you need to look into the rules that apply to schools. For example, you need to know if you have to register your school in a certain way, and if you need to have a license to run a school.\n\nIf you want to run an institution, you need to look into the rules that apply to institutions. For example, you need to know if you have to register your institution in a certain way, and if you need to have a license to run an institution.\n\nIf you want to run a business offering educational services, you need to make sure that you're allowed to run that kind of business. If you want to run a school, you need to make sure that you're allowed to run a school. If you want to run an institution, you need to make sure that you're allowed to run an institution.\n\nAnswer: I think it is very difficult to build a startup in STEM education.  The market is already very well", "I'm currently working on a project that aims to solve this problem. It is called [iXperience](http://www.ixperience.org).\n\niXperience is a web-based system that offers educators a virtual learning environment that allows them to create, manage, and deliver their own STEM resources.\n\nIt provides:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Website:} a website where you can make your own pages, upload files, and create activities;\n\\item \\strong{Server-side:} a set of back-end services that let you store and retrieve data about the activities you create;\n\\item \\strong{Client-side:} a set of JavaScript libraries and APIs that let you easily create activities and engage students;\n\\item \\strong{Mobile companion:} a native iOS app that allows you to view the activities you create.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou can access the server-side API and the mobile app through a free account.\n\nComment: Awesome, I'll check it out ASAP, thanks!\n\nComment: Also, you should check out [OpenTok](http://www.tokbox.com/opentok), which is an open-source video chat SDK. There are a lot of interesting applications of it in STEM education.\n\nAnswer: As a former high-school teacher in the UK, this is a really tough question to answer. I'm an educator first and foremost, so I have a certain amount of insight into the classroom. I'll try to answer as best as I can but I'm sure there will be things I'm missing.\n\n\\section{Web-based}\n\nThe major problem with this is that you need a decent internet connection to use it. Also, it's hard to engage students with the internet when you're teaching a class. If you're going to use a web-based system, you need to create something that has a wide range of functionality.\n\n\\section{Mobile App}\n\nThis has a lot of potential. Any app you create should be designed for teachers to use in the classroom. It should be a companion to the lesson, not a replacement for the teacher.\n\nOne of the key problems with education is that teachers often don't have time to create lessons. If you can give them a tool that they can use to create lessons quickly, with pre-made content on a range of subjects, they can use it in the classroom.\n\nThe biggest problem with education is that teachers have a lot of administrative tasks to do. If you can create a tool that helps teachers with this, you're onto a winner.\n\nComment: Great points, thanks for the help! I'll keep all of this in mind as I develop the company and it's product.\n\nAnswer: I would suggest for a startup in STEM education would be to focus on the content. I think there is a lot of money to be made in creating content, and then licensing it out to schools. It's a lot of work, but I think the potential is there.\n\nComment: Good idea, I'll keep this in mind. Thanks!\n\nAnswer: I'm a teacher and I'm thinking about STEM education in my own country (Chile).\n\nI've thought in a mobile application with the following features:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Questions for students to practice their knowledge.\n\\item Gamification, to make the experience more fun.\n\\item Teachers can create their own questions.\n\\item Teachers can track the student's progress.\n\\item Teachers can create groups to share the questions with other students.\n\\item Students can share their scores with other students.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI think that the most important thing is to know what the student's needs are, so I've interviewed some teachers and I've asked them about problems they have, about what they would like to see in a similar application and about their opinions on gamification.\n\nNow I'm making a prototype.\n\nComment: Great idea, and thanks for the tips! I'll keep them in mind as I develop the company.\n\nAnswer: STEM lessons are best learnt by \\strong{doing}.\n\nSo create a platform that will allow students and teachers to do STEM projects.\n\n\\strong{Platform}\n\nThe platform will be a website that will have a database of projects, some will be free to access while others will require payment.", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat are some good ideas for a startup in STEM education?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSTEM education is a big area, so you would need to focus on a specific part of it.\n\nIf you are interested in helping students who are struggling with math or science, there is already a big market for tutoring and other supplemental education services. It is very difficult to break into this market, since it is very competitive. If you are able to create a program that is very effective and/or is able to significantly undercut the competition, you may have a chance at being successful.\n\nAnother opportunity may be working with schools to create programs to teach robotics, coding, or other STEM subjects in a way that is engaging for students. The goal would be to make the lessons interactive and hands on so that students are learning by doing.\n\nComment: I thought that this could be a good idea. I was also thinking about something like an online chat where a child can ask his/her questions about something related to science or math and get a detailed explanation/answer.\n\nComment: @YashSharma I've seen a few online tutoring platforms like this, but it's a very competitive space. To be successful, you would need a very effective program with good advertising."]}

For example, if you know they're a musician, you could get them a guitar pick.\n\nAnswer: I think you can either give them a card or go with something practical that the person would like.  I think one good idea is to get an Amazon gift card.  This way they can get something they like that you wouldn't know to get them.  If you aren't sure what they like, some other good ideas are a book or a movie.\n\nComment: Good suggestions.  I just want to point out that, if you're going to give a book or movie, it's best to have some idea of the person's interests.  If they're a film buff, but you don't know what kind of films they like, don't give them a movie.  The same goes for books.\n\nAnswer: How about a gift card to a restaurant that they like?  It might be good to ask around and find out if they like a particular restaurant.\n\nAnswer: You could buy them a gift card to a store of their choice.  Or you could buy them some sort of item that they might like to use, but make sure it's not too personal and that you get the right size, etc.\n\nComment: A gift card is impersonal.  A gift certificate to a local store is a good bet for someone you don't know well."]}

I'm not sure what the situation is (i.e. how old your daughter is, what your visitation schedule is, etc), but I think you should let her know that you are concerned, and would like to start to \"wean\" her off of the attachment to you.  Maybe you can even ask her mother to start to ease the transition, by having her daughter spend a little more time with her, and less time with you.  I know that it might not be easy to do, but you need to let her know that you're concerned, and need to start to get her settled in to her new lifestyle.  I know it's hard, but it's something that you have to do.  Also, make sure to keep talking with your daughter, and let her know that you love her, and that she's going to be okay.  It's a difficult situation, but with time and patience, you'll both get through this.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhy are toddlers so clingy?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause they have no other option. If you are their parent, they are your responsibility and you need to take care of them.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat to do about clingy toddlers?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nDo what you are supposed to do as a parent. Do not neglect your child. Children need attention and care.\n\nAnswer: I think you have to do what you think is best for the situation. If she is coming to your house I would talk to her about it. Ask her if there is any way you can make her more comfortable. Maybe she is scared about you moving to your new house? Maybe she is scared about you not being there to pick her up from school? Ask her mother if it is okay to give her a phone call every day to check in on her. Maybe that would help her feel more comfortable. As for her mother...I would talk to her about it...ask her why she is so clingy. It could be a number of things.\n\nAnswer: If she is not used to being apart from her mother, it is going to take a while before she will feel comfortable with you.\n\nIt would be good to talk to her mother about it.\n\nYou could also start by doing small things like, if you have a new house, maybe get her to help you plant flowers in the garden, or get her to help you cook dinner.\n\nHopefully she will start to settle in quickly.", "I am not a psychologist, but I have experienced this with my son, and I have read up on it and have had discussions about it.\n\nI think the most important thing is to stay calm, and not get overly excited. I have noticed that he responds to how I react. If he cries, or gets upset, I stay calm, and I don't get mad. I hug him, and tell him it's okay.\n\nAnd if he does get too clingy, I let him know, and explain to him that he needs to let go. I have a friend that is a psychologist, and she has told me that he is just testing me, and trying to see how far he can test me. I am not sure if that is the case for everyone, but that is what I think.\n\nIt is very normal for children to be clingy, and to get upset. My son is 2, and it is still happening. I think the more you try to get upset, the more he will want to cling, because he knows that it upsets you.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nComment: Thanks for this. I've tried a few of these things, but it is difficult when you're in the middle of a busy city. I'm not sure how best to handle it.\n\nComment: It's definitely not easy! It's a hard situation to be in. But I think the more you stay calm, the better it'll be. It's hard to not get upset, but it's worth it. I know it's hard, but try your best not to get upset.\n\nComment: It's hard not to get upset when you have a child hanging onto you in an airport and other people are trying to get past!\n\nAnswer: The first thing I would say is that, you haven't indicated the nature of your relationship with your son, but it is likely that this behavior is a result of something that is going on in your relationship with your son.\n\nYou can try to ignore your son's behavior and respond to his emotional needs only when you think that he is ready to play or relax, but your son is likely to get upset, and you have to consider what the impact of that will be on your relationship with your son.\n\nThe first thing I would recommend is to speak to your son about his behavior and explain to him what you are trying to achieve. For example, if you are visiting the mall, you can tell your son that you are very busy today, and that you will not be able to spend a lot of time with him. However, you will be happy to spend some time with him, but you will have to do other things as well.\n\nIf you can, you can try to use some positive reinforcement with your son, and tell him that you will be happy to spend time with him when he is happy and relaxed.\n\nIf you have more questions about how to handle this situation, I would suggest that you speak to your son's pediatrician, who can help you to find the best solution for your son.\n\nComment: I can't speak to my son about his behaviour at the moment. He's only 2 and I don't think he's able to understand.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I understand that you can't talk to your son about his behavior, but it is likely that your son is aware of his behavior and is trying to get your attention. If you can, you can try to use some positive reinforcement with your son, and tell him that you will be happy to spend time with him when he is happy and relaxed.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I would also suggest that you speak to your son's pediatrician, who can help you to find the best solution for your son.", "The short answer is that it's a phase and it's going to pass.\n\nThe long answer is that you're in a difficult position as a parent, and you have to find a way that works for you.\n\nThe parenting styles that you describe come from two different philosophies:  \\em{attachment parenting} and \\em{cry it out}.\n\nThere are a lot of variations on these philosophies, but fundamentally they are about how you parent your child.  Attachment parenting is about being close to your child as much as possible, breastfeeding, and providing lots of emotional support, while cry it out is about providing as little emotional support as possible, teaching children to sleep on their own, and allowing them to cry until they do so.\n\nA lot of people have very polarised feelings about these two parenting styles, and they can be quite judgemental about people who don't subscribe to their particular philosophy.\n\nBoth styles are effective in raising children (i.e. children raised by both attachment and cry it out parents grow up to be healthy adults).  But there is a tradeoff.  Attachment parenting is time consuming, and cry it out is not.  If you try to do both, you have to find a way to be close to your child when you can, and to be emotionally supportive to them when you can, while also providing them with a level of independence and learning to sleep through the night at the same time.\n\nI think that it's important to note that \\em{attachment parenting} is not a style of parenting that most parents who do it would advocate for everyone.  It's not the only way to raise children, and it's not even the best way to raise children.  \\em{Cry it out} is actually the best way to raise children, and the most effective (in terms of outcomes).  But it's not the most palatable - it's difficult to watch your child cry, and it's not fun.  So attachment parenting is a more practical style of parenting for most people, as it's less draining and less time consuming.  But it's also less effective in terms of the development of the child.\n\nIn terms of how to raise your child, I think you need to look at what your child needs from you, and what you need from your child.  Parenting is all about give and take.  You have to be willing to give your child \\em{some} of what they want, and they have to be willing to give \\em{some} of what you want.  A good parent is one who can find that balance and provide it for their child.  If you can do that, and your child is happy with that, then you're doing a good job.\n\nIf you're trying to do both attachment parenting and cry it out at the same time, you're going to find it difficult.  But if you can find a way to do it, then you'll be doing a good job.\n\nThe best thing that you can do is to find a balance that works for you.  You'll probably have to make compromises, both with your child, and with yourself.  But if you can find a balance that works for both of you, then you'll be doing a good job.\n\nThe most important thing is to be aware of what your child needs, and to try to provide that for them.  You're the best judge of what your child needs, so trust your instincts.  If your child is happy, then you're doing a good job.\n\nComment: I think that's a really good answer and it makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much. I think, in terms of parenting philosophy, I'd have to say I was more of an attachment parent. I think my first child, because of how I parented her, was a bit clingy and I had to do a bit of cry it out with her. With my second, I'm not sure I've done any cry it out at all. I did cry it out a bit with my third, but only because she cried so much. I think it's really important to listen to your instincts, and do what you think is best for your child.", "I'm not sure that this is what you're looking for, but I'm going to go ahead and write it anyway.\n\nWhenever I'm having a hard time writing a paper, I ask myself two questions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What is the easiest way to get someone to understand what I'm trying to say?\n\\item What is the easiest way to get someone to remember what I'm trying to say?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThese two things are related, but not the same.  In general, if you can convince someone that something is important, they will remember it.  But you have to be able to convince them that what you're saying is important.  To do that, you have to express it in terms that they can understand.\n\nLet's say you're writing a paper on the theory of relativity.  Many people will not understand the math.  But they might be able to understand the concepts.  So you have to be able to express the concepts in simple terms.  I'm sure that there are many ways to do this.  For example, you could put the idea in a historical context, so that people can see why it is important.  You could also use analogies to help people understand what you're talking about.  For example, you could say that time is like a rubber band.  It stretches when you pull on it.\n\nSo that's one way to do it.  Another way would be to focus on the implications of the theory.  For example, you could talk about how the theory has been used to predict the existence of black holes and gravitational waves.  You could also talk about how the theory has been used to explain the expansion of the universe.\n\nSo those are just two examples.  There are probably many other ways to do it.  But the important thing is to find a way that will make your paper easier to understand.  That way, people will be more likely to remember what you're talking about.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer to my question. I think that your second point is the best one for me to work on: explaining the implications of the theory. I have been using analogies a bit in my paper, and that has helped. I'll try to focus more on the implications.\n\nComment: Glad to help.

It is a sign of rot.\n\nRot is caused by a fungus. You can get rid of it by cleaning all the soil off the plant with a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water. Then, soak the plant in a solution of one part bleach to 99 parts water.\n\nDo this once a month for 3 months.

There are two ways to get rid of root rot:\n\n\\strong{Method One:}\n\nCut off the infected roots and replant the plant in a new pot with new soil.\n\n\\strong{Method Two:}\n\nIf you can't cut off all the infected roots, then you need to repot the plant in a new pot with new soil. However, to do this you need to be sure that you are using a pot that has holes in the bottom. Make sure that you put rocks in the bottom of the pot before putting the dirt in. This will keep the plant from sitting in water because the water will slowly drain out through the rocks.\n\n[This article has more information about repotting your plants](http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/houseplants/hpgen/repotting-houseplants.htm).\n\nAnswer: Snake plant is a very tough plant. It is drought tolerant and grows best when potting soil is allowed to get slightly dry between waterings.\n\nThe best way to water is to drench the soil and then let the excess water drain away. You can do this by placing the potted plant in the sink and running water over the soil until excess water flows out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot.\n\nSnake plant grows best in bright light but can tolerate low light. It is also considered a succulent and will survive low moisture conditions.\n\nAnswer: Snake plant is a hardy succulent that is easy to care for, but can be tricky to get right. It needs a well-draining soil that is not too wet or too dry.\n\nIf you think you may have overwatered your snake plant, the first thing to do is check the soil. If it is wet or soggy, then you have overwatered. To fix this, simply remove the plant from the pot and let the soil dry out completely. Once the soil is dry, you can put the plant back in the pot.\n\nIf the soil is dry, then you may need to water your plant more often. To check if the soil is dry, stick your finger into the soil up to the first knuckle. If it feels dry, then it\u2019s time to water.\n\nAnswer: The leaves of my snake plant were getting soggy and falling off. I was watering it once a month, as you said. I thought that it was because I was overwatering it. But after reading this article, I realized that I needed to change the soil. I did that and now the leaves are staying on and the plant is healthy. Thanks for the advice!", "There are two reasons I can think of.\n\nFirst, it might be that there is no drainage hole in the pot. This can be a common mistake and can lead to root rot.\n\nSecond, it might be that the pot was not dry enough before you watered it. Check the soil to make sure it is dry. If not, you might want to repot it again.\n\nAnswer: It might be that you watered the plant too much.

Can you give me specific tips to kick their asses?\nExplain the technique please.", "response_list": ["I'm not sure I understand the question. Are you asking for advice on how to bowl better?\n\nIf so, I think the best advice I can give you is to practice a lot. Bowling is a physical sport that requires the coordination and strength of your muscles, bones and joints. The more you practice, the better your body will get at bowling.\n\nFor example, if you practice a lot, your muscles will get stronger and you'll be able to throw the ball harder and with more accuracy. Your bones and joints will also get stronger, which will allow you to apply more power to your bowling shot.\n\nIn addition, practice will also help you develop a better sense of how the ball will move once you release it. This is important because it will help you become more consistent in your bowling shots.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer.

Practice.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer. What are the tips to kick their asses", "I'm not an expert, but I've played a bit with [Bowling](http://sport.eserver.org/bowling/) and [Bowling100](http://www.pixelgames.fr/bowling100/index.html).\n\nIn Bowling, the ball is launched at a fixed speed.  The strength is determined by the angle at which the ball is launched.  Therefore, you can choose between 2 launching strategies:\n\n1) Launch the ball at an angle that is optimal for the lane (ie, it's at an angle where the ball will hit the pins with enough force, but at an angle where the pins will be knocked down).\n\n2) Launch the ball as fast as possible at a given angle.  This increases the chances that the ball will hit the pins with enough force to knock them down, but at a bad angle.  This can be compensated by choosing a lane with more pins.\n\nIn Bowling100, the ball speed is controlled by a power meter.  A good strategy is to launch the ball at a high speed while the ball is still on the launching lane, and then angle it in a way that will knock down the pins.\n\nAnswer: There are several things you can do to improve your bowling score.\n\n1) Make sure you are wearing the correct shoes. Bowling shoes are designed for bowling and have a special sole that will allow you to slide when delivering the ball. If you are wearing regular shoes you are going to lose a lot of energy that could be directed at the ball. If you wear the wrong shoes it is likely that you will develop knee or back problems.\n\n2) Learn how to deliver the ball correctly. You want to roll the ball in a straight line without a lot of spin. This means that you don't want to twist your wrist when throwing the ball. Instead you want to keep your arm straight and the ball will roll straight.\n\n3) Make sure the ball is in the correct spot. You want to keep your non-throwing hand behind the ball and your throwing hand in front of the ball. This will allow you to have a straight path and will also allow you to throw the ball properly.\n\n4) Practice. The more you bowl the better you will get. Try bowling in a league so you can get lots of practice each week.\n\n5) Learn how the ball reacts when thrown. The first thing you want to do is find a lane that is about 30 feet long. This will allow you to get a feel for the ball as it rolls down the lane. Once you get the feel for the ball you can start to experiment with different techniques.\n\n6) Practice your technique. The more you bowl the better you will get.\n\n7) Practice your stance. You want to stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Keep your toes pointed straight ahead and your heels aligned with your toes.\n\n8) Practice your steps. You want to take a step forward with your non-throwing foot and then a step back with your throwing foot.\n\n9) Practice your release. You want to release the ball at the same time you are stepping back.\n\n10) Practice your follow through. You want to keep your throwing arm straight and your non-throwing arm bent.\n\n11) Practice your aim. You want to aim for the center of the lane.\n\n12) Practice your ball speed. You want to throw the ball at about 10 miles per hour.\n\n13) Practice your release. You want to release the ball as you step back with your throwing foot.\n\n14) Practice your follow through. You want to keep your throwing arm straight and your non-throwing arm bent.\n\n15) Practice your aim. You want to aim for the center of the lane.\n\n16) Practice your release.

They'll be boiled.\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: I mean that \"boiling\" can mean any water that isn't cold.\n\nComment: @Tomas: You're confusing the verb \"boil\" with the noun \"boil\".  The verb \"boil\" means to heat water to a temperature of 212F.  The noun \"boil\" is the state of water that is at a temperature of 212F.\n\nComment: @Tomas: I think you're using an incorrect definition of the word \"boil\".  I think you're using the verb \"boil\" when you should be using the noun \"boil\".  If water at 212F is \"boiling\", then water at 200F is \"boiling\", too.  And water at 100F is \"boiling\", too.  But none of those things are \"boiling\".\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: My problem is that I don't know the word for a water that is not cold. I know that \"boiling\" can mean \"212\u00b0F and above\", but I don't know what it means to say that the water is boiling when it's not 212\u00b0F.\n\nComment: @Tomas: You're using the word \"boil\" when you mean \"heat to the temperature of 212F\".  That's not the right word to use.  The correct word to use is \"heat to the temperature of 212F\".  You should say \"heat the water to the temperature of 212F\".  You should never say \"boil the water\".\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: It's just that I like calling all the water that is not cold \"boiling water\".\n\nComment: @Tomas: It's inaccurate and misleading.  Boiled eggs are not the same as poached eggs.  And if you call water that is less than 212F \"boiling water\", then I don't know what to say.\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: I think it's just a matter of preference.  I like using that term because it's shorter than \"water that is not cold\".\n\nComment: @Tomas: Well, if you want to be precise, then you shouldn't use the term \"boiling water\".  You should use the term \"water that is not cold\".\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.\n\nComment: @Tomas: I think it's important to be precise when it comes to cooking.  Using imprecise terms in a cooking context can lead to confusion and bad results.\n\nComment: @CodeGnome: Well, it's not like you can burn an egg if you call it \"boiling water\" when it's not.

I'd say that the white will be a little more watery than if it were cooked for longer (which you can see on the eggs that you cook in boiling water).

I leave them in there for a few minutes, and they come out perfectly.  I have also used them in omelets, and the whites mash just like you would expect a poached egg to.  I have also used them on sandwiches, etc, and they work fine.\n\nIf you're having trouble with the white getting rubbery, you could try boiling the eggs for a shorter period of time.  Or, as mentioned above, you could put a little vinegar in the water.  It's probably not necessary, but it's harmless.

The yolk will be overcooked and tough, while the whites will be overcooked and dry. And if the egg is overcooked a bit, you may have a little green ring around the yolk, which is not very appetizing to most diners.\n\nComment: I don't see how this answers the question.

I did not think of doing that when I wrote this answer.\n\nAnswer: I will not claim to be an expert on poached eggs, but I have seen them done at some restaurants.

I am a novice.\n\nComment: It's possible I misread your question.  You said \"including confidence interval.\"  The formulas in the paper compute the confidence interval for the agreement measures.  Do you want to compute the confidence interval for your agreement measure?  If so, you should be able to use the formulas from the paper.  If not, you can use a different method.

The 95% confidence interval is the range of values for that statistic.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSo, assuming your data are arranged in a matrix with rows for the 350 examples and columns for the two annotators, the \u03ba statistic is the proportion of elements in the diagonal of the matrix that are 1. The 95% confidence interval is a range around that proportion such that 95% of the time, the true value will be contained in that range.\n\nThe formulas for the \u03ba statistic and its confidence interval are given in the paper you linked to.\n\nComment: I'm not familiar with the formula. Could you explain it briefly?\n\nComment: I've added some explanation.", "There are many methods for measuring inter-annotator agreement.\n\nIn particular, the Cohen's Kappa statistic is often used.\n\nThe formula for Cohen's Kappa is:\n\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{(p_o - p_e)}{(1 - p_e)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{(r_i-p_e)}{p_e}}{N(N-1)} $$\n\nwhere $p_e$ is the expected agreement of annotators, which is just the proportion of the agreement, and $r_i$ is the observed agreement of annotators.\n\nYou can find more information on Cohen's Kappa [here](https://www.dssresearch.com/kappa-statistic/).", "First, you need to compute the agreement between the two annotators.

Kappa is a statistic for measuring agreement. It is not a score.\n\nComment: @ToddH It's a score. A score is a metric that measures the quality of something, and kappa is a metric that measures the agreement between annotators. I don't know of any other way to call it.\n\nComment: I guess I'm one of those people who gets irritated by the misuse of the term \"score\". A score is a value computed from a set of data. Kappa is not a score. It's a measure of agreement between annotators.\n\nComment: @ToddH Then what would you call it? What I called a score is what I think is the most accurate way to call it. I'm open to suggestions.\n\nComment: I'd call it \"kappa\" or \"kappa coefficient\" or something like that. That's what the literature does. It's not a score.", "I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"confidence interval\", but the [F-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) is a common metric for evaluating inter-annotator agreement.\n\nIf you want to compute the F-score, you should use a tool like the [AgreementPlotter](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/agreement_plotter) which will calculate the F-score for you based on your annotation.\n\nComment: Thank you for the reference.

There are many steps involved, and you will be up against the big boys (PG&E, Cal Energy, etc.).  It is a lot more complicated than just \"building it.\"\n\nComment: Thanks for the info. I guess the question needs to be refined a bit. Any ideas on how to start a competing electricity provider.\n\nComment: The question has been reworded.  Please feel free to add or subtract from it to make it more clear.  To start a competing electricity provider, you will have to go through the same process as I described.  It is not a fast process.  You will be competing against companies that have been around for years and have a lot of clout with the state.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: My answer has not changed.  I simply added an explanation.", "You have to first understand the business of electricity and how it is generated and delivered. From there you can start to come up with a plan to compete.\n\nPG&E has a monopoly and does not have to compete with anyone. They can charge whatever they want, within reason, to their customers. They have a regulated rate of return so they make money off of the rate they charge times the amount of power they deliver.\n\nTheir rates are what they are because of the cost of generating the power and delivering it. Generating power is expensive. Building and maintaining a power plant is expensive. The transmission lines that get the electricity to your house are expensive.\n\nIf you want to be competitive, you not only have to be able to generate the power at a lower cost, but you have to be able to distribute it to the customers profitably. That is almost a certain impossibility.\n\nThere are some companies like Arcadia power that are trying to do this. They have a special rate where you can buy \"green energy\" at a premium. But they don't actually generate the energy they sell you, they buy it from PG&E.\n\nSo think about this. How are you going to generate your own electricity and get it to the customers cheaper than PG&E can?", "There are many things you need to consider.  Before you start a business, you need to have a customer.  The PG&E customers are the rate payers.  There are two types of rate payers, residential and commercial.  Commercial customers represent roughly 30% of the billings, so if you are going after PG&E customers, you will need to target the residential market.\n\nPG&E has a monopoly on the distribution of power in the Bay Area.  There is no way to start a business that will directly compete with PG&E because they have a monopoly on the distribution of electricity.  You will have to create a product that is different from power in some way.  The most obvious product is green power.  There are many companies that produce green power in California.  I know of a few, and I am sure there are others.  You will have to find a niche in this market.  It is already established.\n\nYou will need to have a business plan and you will need to have financial commitment.  You will need to understand what your competition is doing.  I suggest that you talk with some of these other power companies and see what the opportunities are.  You will need to find a market.  You will need to find a way to get the power to the people.  You will need to find a way to get paid.\n\nThere are many other factors involved. I suggest that you do a lot of research before you even consider starting this type of business.  You will need to find people that know more about this type of business than you do.  Do you know anything about how electricity is generated and distributed?  Do you know how to get power from a power plant to a home?  Do you know how to bill people for power?  Do you know anything about the power industry?\n\nAnswer: There are two things to consider:\n\n\\strong{Energy}\n\n1. You can't compete with PG&E directly. PG&E has a monopoly on electricity distribution and is the only company allowed to sell electricity for delivery to your home. You can only compete with them by providing a service that PG&E doesn't provide.\n\n2. You can compete with them by producing a renewable energy product, like solar or wind. But you won't be doing the production, you'll be selling power generated by other companies.\n\n3. You can compete with them by providing a product that is more convenient to the customer, like allowing people to pay their bills online.\n\n\\strong{Gas}\n\nGas is a little different. PG&E has a monopoly on distribution of gas to your home, but you \\em{can} compete directly with PG&E to provide the gas.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. What I am saying is that I want to compete with PG&E by starting a company that is the cheapest and the most reliable. I know that I can't simply start a company to compete with PG&E on energy production, but I can start a company to compete with them on all other aspects of the business.", "You would need to apply for a license to become a retail energy supplier in California.\n\nThese licenses are available from the California Public Utilities Commission:\n\nhttp://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/electric/ElectricSuppliers/\n\nThere are a few steps involved.\n\nYou'll need to pick a service area (counties and cities) that you'd like to provide service to.\n\nThen you'll need to provide a ton of information to the PUC and get them to approve your application.\n\nOnce you're approved, you'll need to get a license in each zip code that you'll be selling electricity to.\n\nThen you'll need to set up some way to bill your customers.\n\nThen you'll need to figure out how you're going to generate the electricity that you'll be selling.\n\nThen you'll need to actually go out and start selling electricity.\n\nYou'll need to get a customer service/billing system set up.\n\nYou'll need to be able to report your data to the PUC on a regular basis.\n\nYou'll need to make sure you have enough cash to actually pay for the electricity you're selling.\n\nThen you'll need to go out and find a bunch of customers.\n\nOnce you have a bunch of customers, you'll need to actually provide them with electricity.\n\nThen you'll need to deal with whatever customer bills come in.\n\nThen repeat the whole process again.\n\nIt will probably take you at least a year to actually get your company up and running.\n\nComment: This is an excellent answer.  I would only add that the OP would need to make sure they understand how much money is in this business.  In the last 10 years, many people have tried to become electricity providers and failed.  They can't make money, even with deregulation.\n\nComment: In the last 10 years, many people have tried to become electricity providers and failed.\n\nThe industry has been deregulated since 1996.

{"prompt": "What is the difference between you and a human?", "response_list": ["\\section{Covariant}\n\nCovariant variables change with a change in frame of reference.  They can be converted from one frame of reference to another without changing the underlying physics.  In your example, the change in velocity of the ball is a covariant variable.  No matter how the ball moves, the change in velocity is the same (relative to the ball).\n\n\\section{Contravariant}\n\nContravariant variables, on the other hand, change as you change frames of reference.  For example, in your example, the velocity of a ball is a contravariant variable, because if you are moving with the ball, then the velocity of the ball is zero.  If you are moving away from the ball, then the velocity of the ball is non-zero.  These kinds of variables are typically called \"tensor fields\" because they have properties that are different in different coordinates.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer! So in general, the difference between covariant and contravariant variables is that the former are invariant under change of frame of reference, while the latter change as the frame of reference changes. Is that correct?\n\nComment: @user2146791: that's correct!\n\nComment: @user2146791: Also, contravariant vectors are usually denoted by a comma instead of a dot.

Why would you expect that to work?  You have to tell C# that you want to create a new `GameObject` instance and assign it to `game.gameObject`, not `game`.\n\nComment: It doesn't work because it's not going to assign a new `GameObject` instance to `game.gameObject` if you assign `game` to a new `Game` object.

The trick is to position the chain on the wheel, then wrap it up all the way around the wheel.  Here are some pictures:\n\n<IMAGE>\n<IMAGE>\n<IMAGE>", "\\section{Apply snow chains to the front wheels}\n\nThe front tires are going to be the ones that are going to be spinning, so they are the ones that are going to build up ice underneath them.  The rear tires have a tendency to stay on the road better, and don't have as much of a load on them as the front tires do, so they won't build up ice as fast, and if they do, the ice won't be as large.\n\nHaving said that, most cars have a differential that splits the power between the front tires, so the rear tires will spin also, and build up ice.\n\n\\section{Apply snow chains to the rear wheels}\n\nThe rear tires are going to be the ones that are going to get the most slippage, and build up ice the fastest.  If you apply the snow chains to the rear tires, they'll build up ice faster, and you'll probably spin them out and get stuck.\n\n\\section{Apply snow chains to the front and rear wheels}\n\nIf your car has a locking differential, apply the snow chains to both the front and rear tires.  This will reduce the chance that the rear wheels will spin out and get stuck.\n\nComment: In most cars, snow chains will have no effect as the wheels are driven separately in each direction (the front wheels turn left and the rear wheels turn right at the same time).  The differential only comes into play at speed, when the car is turning.  At low speed, the tires are more like a pendulum, rotating in opposite directions, but the front and rear wheels will both spin.\n\nComment: @ChrisH: You're correct, however not all cars have a differential.  I was thinking of rear wheel drive cars only.\n\nComment: I'm actually quite surprised that you don't have to wear seat belts in the back of the car.\n\nComment: @Tim: I've never worn a seatbelt.

You'll need to use the socket wrench ratchet to do it in reverse.\n\nOnce the nut has been loosened, take the socket wrench off, and remove the extension.\n\nTake the impact driver, and place the extension on the lug nut.

In the end, you will get a lot of false positives.\n\nThe way to go is to add a \"To:\" field in your email form. If the user doesn't fill it, you will just send the email to your contact form and ask the user to provide the address of the person he wants to contact.\n\nComment: +1 for the \"To:\" field: if the mail doesn't fit a pattern (i.e. the user has just entered a random string) then it's probably spam.\n\nAnswer: I'd check the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item No more than 50 words in the message\n\\item No subject\n\\item No HTML\n\\item No attachments\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI'd also check the headers and check that the IP address and hostname both appear to be valid.\n\nComment: You need to be able to allow attachments for legitimate messages.\n\nComment: @Tom - I agree, but I'd probably want to check the file extension to make sure it's something that shouldn't be executed.\n\nAnswer: I'd probably do something like:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Check for any \"suspicious\" characters in the message body (i.e. control characters, etc. that may indicate malicious code)\n\\item Check for any suspicious characters in the subject line (again, control characters, etc.)\n\\item Check for certain key words in the message body (i.e. \"click here\" etc.)\n\\item Check for IP addresses that are not in the same range as the email server (i.e. the IP address that sent the email is not in the same range as the IP address of the server)\n\\item Check the email header and make sure it is valid\n\\item Check the body for a certain number of words (i.e. more than 50 words)\n\\item Check for any attachments and the file extension (i.e. no zip, exe, etc.)\n\\item Check for a certain number of lines (i.e. more than 20)\n\\item Compare the message body length to the message body size in the email header\n\\item Check the IP Address for a blacklisted address\n\\item Check the body for a certain number of characters (i.e. more than 500)\n\\item Check the body for a certain number of lines (i.e. more than 20)\n\\item Check the subject for a certain number of lines (i.e. more than 10)\n\\item Check the body for a certain number of characters (i.e. more than 500)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAll of this is only a very general guideline, so you'll have to make your own list of things to check.\n\nComment: This is a good list, but you need to consider that some things, such as a large number of words in the subject line, can be used for legitimate email as well.\n\nAnswer: I would have a look at [SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org/).  It is a mail filter that looks for patterns in email headers and content which are typical of spam.  For example, words that are often in spam such as \"viagra\" or \"lady parts\".  It can also be trained by the user to recognise their own email traffic and whitelist it.  Also, spam is usually sent in bulk, so you could also look for a high number of messages from the same source in a short period of time.\n\nThere is a lot of information on the SpamAssassin site.  It may or may not be what you are looking for, but it's worth checking out.\n\nAnswer: Too many spammers are smart enough to not put \"viagra\" in the message, so you can't use that.\n\nThe best solution is to send an email to your contact form, and ask the user to enter the email address he/she wants to send to.  That's how it's done on Stack Overflow.", "A simple statistical approach might be to count the number of emails the user receives per day, and if a user receives a significantly larger number of emails in a single day, then the email is likely to be spam.\n\n\\strong{EDIT}: I had originally stated that the user could be prompted to mark certain emails as spam.  This isn't necessary though if a user is willing to let their email client send emails to a server each time they log in.  The server can then count emails and determine when a user is receiving a large number of emails.  If a user is getting a large number of emails, then the server can notify the user that they are probably receiving spam.\n\nComment: I like this solution.  It would be interesting to see how many people would be willing to have their mail client send their email data to a server for the purposes of this functionality (or if they could be prompted to mark certain emails as spam).\n\nComment: I think a lot of people would be willing to do this if it could help them fight spam.\n\nComment: I think this would be more effective than a spam filter that looks at the content of the email, because it would not have to be updated as often.  It would also be harder for spammers to get around.\n\nComment: This is a really good idea, but it would probably have the greatest effectiveness in countries where the majority of internet users are savvy users who are aware of spam and don't open or download it.\n\nComment: I agree that it would be most effective in countries with internet savvy users.  Also, I think it might be hard for spammers to get around this since they can't just change the contents of their emails to get by a filter that uses this approach.\n\nAnswer: The typical spam filter is a combination of blacklisting, whitelisting, and text analysis.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Blacklisting is a list of known spam domains that the mail server will not deliver messages from.\n\\item Whitelisting is a list of known trusted domains that the mail server will always deliver messages from.  This is the opposite of blacklisting.\n\\item Text analysis is a list of words or phrases that are known to be in spam emails.  If a message contains a word or phrase from this list, then it is considered to be spam.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThere are many other approaches to spam filtering, but these are the main ones.\n\nComment: Thanks for the response.  What would you say is the most effective approach?\n\nComment: The most effective approach is probably a combination of blacklisting and whitelisting with text analysis.  The whitelisting is the most effective part because it's the hardest for spammers to get around.  Spammers can change the contents of their email to get around a filter that looks at the contents of the email, but they can't change the domain they are sending from (if the domain is on the whitelist).\n\nComment: I like the way blacklisting and whitelisting can be used in combination with text analysis.\n\nAnswer: How do you expect the spam filter to be used?  Will it be built into the browser and the user will be prompted to classify each email as spam or ham?  If so, then it will have to have a large database of spam examples and a large database of classifications made by users.  It will also have to have a way of learning from the mistakes that user makes.\n\nDo you expect the spam filter to be used by the mail server where the user gets their email?  Then it will have to scan every email and classify it as spam or ham and then be able to compare the spam with the examples it has.  It will also have to learn from the mistakes it makes.\n\nAre you assuming the spam filter will be used by the email client?  Then it will have to scan every email and classify it as spam or ham.  It will also have to compare the spam with the examples it has and learn from the mistakes it makes.\n\nAre you assuming the user will be given a list of emails and asked to classify each as spam or ham?

Then you could check if the message has a specific word (for example: \"FREE\") and if it has it, then you know it's spam.\n\nAnswer: There exist a lot of technologies that can help you in combating spam.\n\nThe most common one is the blacklist. You check the IP address of the sender and if it is blacklisted, then you know it's spam.\n\nYou can also use a whitelist. In this case you know that a message is good if it comes from a whitelisted IP address.\n\nAnother one that I used is the challenge-response system. In this case, you tell your users that messages coming from the challenge-response system are spam, but that you will check them to be sure. Then, you send a challenge to the sender, and if he doesn't answer within a predefined time, your message is spam. The challenge can be a simple text that you ask him to copy and paste in the body of his message, or something more complex like a captcha.\n\nAnd, finally, you can use a challenge-response system that asks the sender to answer a question. For example, you can ask the sender to say how many letters are in the word \"spam\".\n\nAnswer: I'd recommend having a look at http://spamassassin.org/. It's a project that has been around for a long time, and is used by a lot of email service providers.\n\nAnswer: First of all, you could have a look at the [spam filter](http://www.spamassassin.org/) that is part of [Exim](http://www.exim.org/) (see [here](http://www.exim.org/spam.html)).\n\nYou could also use [SpamExperts](http://www.spamexperts.com/), which is similar to [SpamAssassin](http://www.spamassassin.org/).\n\nIf you're just starting out, you could use [SpamCop](http://www.spamcop.net) to identify the spams and see what they have in common, and then implement your own logic for filtering the spams out.\n\nAnswer: One approach is to have the server that sends the email to check if the message is spam.\n\nFor example, if the email contains a link to a page that is a phishing site, the server could block the message as spam.\n\nYou can use the following approach to block phishing sites.\n\nFirst, you can check if the message contains a link to a page with a domain that is known to be a phishing site.\n\nThen, you can check if the message contains a link to a page with a domain that is known to be a spam site.\n\nFinally, you can check if the message contains a link to a page with a domain that is known to be a malicious site."]}

I think the Southern Hemisphere is also the best place to visit in July.\n\nComment: The same thing holds true for the Northern Hemisphere at the same time of year.\n\nComment: @R.. but winter is not the same in both hemispheres.  The opposite months are not the same.  Winter is the coldest part of the year.  Summer is the hottest part of the year.

Not only are the beaches closed, but the weather can be downright depressing for many of us.\n\nComment: I agree, but it's hard to know what the weather will be like unless you have an idea of where you are going.\n\nComment: Sure it is.

And if you're thinking of going to a beach, well there's your problem.\n\nComment: @corsiKa:  If you're on a budget, you're going to want to go somewhere that is warm.  If you like snow, well, you're going to want to go somewhere that is cold.  If you like warm weather, then it's a little harder to pin down unless you're talking about a specific country.  January is still high season for Hawaii, so you might want to go there.  If you're in the US, you might want to go to a ski resort, or some other place where it's snowy.  If you're in Europe, you'd probably want to go somewhere that is warm.  If you're not in the US or Europe, you'd probably want to go somewhere warm as well.\n\nComment: @R..:  I've lived in the US my entire life.  I've never been to Hawaii before, but I've been to Mexico, and I can tell you that the weather is much more pleasant in January there than it is here.  I've been to a ski resort, and it was fun for a weekend, but I'd rather be on the beach.  So, while it's not impossible to go somewhere warm, you still have to have the means to do so.

I think they are more scenic than the trails at Muir Woods, but it's all pretty amazing.\n\nComment: @JeffO:  I have been to both places, and I think Muir Woods is more scenic.  Redwood National Park is not a single tract of land, and there is a lot of it that is not very scenic.  Muir Woods is a single tract of land, and a lot of the scenic area is accessible by roads.  There is a lot of redwoods that you can see from the road.\n\nComment: @chris: I agree that there is a lot of scenery in Muir Woods that you can see from the road. I would say that Redwood National Park is more scenic overall because it is more like a wilderness area, with less development and roads. If you're looking for a place to hike in the redwoods, I would recommend the James Irvine Trail in Redwood National Park.\n\nComment: @JeffO: I have been on the James Irvine Trail, and I think it is less scenic than Muir Woods.  I have been on the trails at Muir Woods, and I think they are all nicer than the James Irvine Trail.  I would say that Muir Woods is more scenic overall.\n\nComment: @chris: You must have an amazing memory to remember it all. I visited both places some time ago and I don't remember much detail about either place. It's hard to say which place is more scenic overall since they are so different.\n\nAnswer: You can also go to Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It's about 6 hours from SF, but it's beautiful, and the drive is nice.", "[Golden Gate National Recreation Area](http://www.nps.gov/goga/index.htm) (GGNRA) is a huge collection of parks in and around San Francisco. It contains the Muir Woods, which have a nice collection of redwood trees. The park itself is a great place to visit and is easy to get to from San Francisco.\n\nAnswer: There are redwoods in the Santa Cruz mountains, which are also very scenic and a popular weekend getaway for SF residents.  There is a state park, Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park (http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=534) in the Santa Cruz mountains, very close to the town of Santa Cruz.  If you're interested in hiking, there's a very scenic hike from the state park to the summit of Mount Umunhum, a former radar site, now an open park.\n\nAnswer: Mt. Tamalpais State Park is great for hiking.  You can drive up and hike the Mountain or drive to the top and walk around.\n\nAnswer: While Muir Woods is a fine place, it's not the only place to see the trees.\n\nThe Marin Headlands, just north of the Muir Woods, have some pretty big trees on the east side of the hill.  You can even go down to the beach and enjoy a picnic on the rocks.\n\nAlso, the redwoods are found on the east side of Highway 1 just north of Half Moon Bay.  The Pescadero State Beach has a short hiking trail that will point you in the right direction.\n\nAnswer: The California Coast Redwoods are beautiful, but they are in southern Oregon, not northern California. If you want to go redwood hunting in CA, you'll have to look at the Coast Redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), not the redwoods (Sequoia gigantea). They are not as tall, but they are still very nice.\n\nThe state parks that have many are Samuel P. Taylor State Park and the Russian River Redwoods. I'm not familiar with Muir Woods, but I've been to both of those. Samuel P. Taylor is a less touristy place, and Russian River is the more touristy place.\n\n[Russian River Redwoods](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=537)\n\n[Samuel P. Taylor](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=242)", "There are many places to see redwoods. A couple of places that come to mind are Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Henry Cowell Redwoods, and the Avenue of the Giants. All of these are within a two-hour drive of San Francisco.\n\nComment: Thanks. Just to clarify, Henry Cowell Redwoods is part of Big Basin Redwoods?\n\nComment: @Jasper: No, they are separate parks, but they are both in the Santa Cruz Mountains.\n\nComment: @Jasper they're in the same area, but they are separate parks.\n\nAnswer: Well, there's redwoods in many places in California. I'd say if you're only going one place, make it Muir Woods, although it will be very crowded. You can also check out [Big Basin Redwoods State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=478), [Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=480), [Armstrong Redwoods State Natural Reserve](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=481), and [Avenue of the Giants](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=482).\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nAnswer: Muir Woods is easily the most accessible, but if you're willing to drive a bit further, you'll find Humboldt Redwoods State Park (and especially the Avenue of the Giants) to be a more rewarding experience.\n\nAnswer: A little known redwood is not in any park. It is a single, giant redwood that has been growing for at least 1,500 years. It is known as the Sausalito Tree. It is located in the Marin Headlands. It is 140 feet tall and 25 feet in diameter.", "I would suggest a trip to Big Sur.\n\nDepending on how much time you have, you can see trees in [Big Basin Redwoods State Park](http://www.parkhere.org/bigbasin/) (south of Santa Cruz), at [Henry Cowell State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=459), [Santa Cruz State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458), [Butano State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=455), the [A\u00f1o Nuevo State Reserve](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=2566), and [The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=457).\n\nComment: As of right now, I have the whole weekend.

I've been to Muir Woods and it was definitely a worthwhile experience.\n\nComment: Muir Woods is the place to go if you are going to see the redwoods.  The Big Tree in the Sequoia National Forest is impressive, but it's not like the redwoods.  The Muir Woods are beautiful, and there are many hikes to enjoy nearby.\n\nAnswer: Muir Woods is a quick drive across the Golden Gate Bridge, and is the best place in the SF Bay Area to see redwoods.\n\nAnswer: Humboldt Redwoods State Park is my favorite place to see redwoods.  The drive on the Avenue of the Giants is a must, and if you want to do a little hiking, the trek to the top of the Lady Bird Johnson Grove is well worth it.\n\nAnswer: If you want to see some ginormous redwoods, there is the Sequoia National Park (which has the General Sherman Tree, which is the largest in the world), or the Redwood National Park.\n\nAnswer: I'm going to give a bit of a different answer here.  There are some really amazing redwoods right in downtown San Francisco.  The tallest and oldest redwood in the city is located on the grounds of the Palace of Fine Arts.  The redwood, named \"Big One\" is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,200 years old.  It's a quick walk (about 10 minutes) from the SF Museum of Modern Art.  It is one of the most beautiful trees I've ever seen.\n\nThe other redwood is located at the Presidio in the Main Post.  It is a bit of a hike to get to it, but the walk is beautiful and the tree is worth the effort.  In fact, the tree has its own website.  It is called the \"Sentinel Tree\" and is located at the top of a hill in the Main Post.  It is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,200 years old.\n\nSo if you are looking for an easy place to visit and see some beautiful redwoods, I would suggest the Palace of Fine Arts.  If you have a little more time (and like a good hike), the Sentinel Tree at the Presidio is well worth the visit.\n\nComment: The Presidio redwood is a beautiful tree, and I've enjoyed its shade on several hikes.\n\nAnswer: Muir Woods is a great place to see redwoods. It's not far from the city and there's a good trail system.\n\nIf you're looking for something more remote than Muir Woods, consider Redwood National Park. It's a few hours north of San Francisco but the drive is beautiful and there are lots of places to hike and camp.\n\nComment: Muir Woods is definitely worth a visit.  I'd prefer to head north to Humboldt Red"]}
{"prompt": "What are the best ways to handle a breakup?", "response_list": ["Let me add my two cents to all of these other answers.  I have a friend who is a pretty normal guy, but he used to be an alcoholic.  He just did it every weekend.  He wasn't in the gutter or anything like that, but he was definitely a drinker.  He was seeing this girl in his apartment complex and they started dating.  He got to the point where he wasn't drinking on the weekends and she was doing something in his life that made him feel better about himself.  She said she didn't like the way he drank, but she didn't want to tell him to stop for some reason.  Well, one night he was drinking and she came over and they got into a fight.  She said that she wanted to leave and he said that he didn't want her to.  She said that she was going to anyway and he grabbed her arm and wouldn't let her leave.  She started hitting and kicking him and he punched her in the face.  She then went to the police and he got arrested.  The cops let him go because he wasn't arrested on the spot.  She told the cops that he was a drinker and that he punched her in the face.  He was arrested the next day for assault and spent the night in jail.  He was released the next day and the girl told the cops that she didn't want to press charges.  He was told by the cops to stay away from her, but she ended up suing him for assault.  She won the lawsuit and he ended up having to pay her a pretty big chunk of change.  He is now a changed man, and has been for a few years now.  But, he still has some of the same habits and he is still a drinker.  But, he doesn't drink every night.  He doesn't drink as much as he used to.  He is more responsible, and he has learned to control his drinking.  So, even though he is still a drinker, he is a better person for it.  I think that it is important to remember that people are not perfect.  We all have our flaws and we all have our demons.  But, we can change.  We can learn and grow and become the person that we want to be.  If you want to be a better person, you have to put in the time and effort.  You can't do it overnight.  You have to be patient and you have to be willing to take the time to work on yourself.  I think that the best way to handle a breakup is to realize that you both have flaws and you both have demons.  You have to be willing to work on yourself so that you can become the person that you want to be.  Then, you can move on from the breakup and focus on the future.\n\nAnswer: There is no right or wrong answer to this question.  The best way to handle a breakup is to be honest with yourself and with your partner.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should talk to your partner about it.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should break up with your partner.  If you are happy in the relationship, then you should stay in the relationship.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should talk to your partner about it.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should break up with your partner.  If you are happy in the relationship, then you should stay in the relationship.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should talk to your partner about it.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should break up with your partner.  If you are happy in the relationship, then you should stay in the relationship.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should talk to your partner about it.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should break up with your partner.  If you are happy in the relationship, then you should stay in the relationship.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should talk to your partner about it.  If you are not happy in the relationship, then you should break up with your partner.  If you are happy in the relationship, then you should stay in the relationship.

It's not that I'm not in love with her, but I feel like we just grew apart over time (and I'm also a teenager, so it's hard to say). Is there an easy way to say this to her?\n\nComment: @johnny: \"We grew apart\" is a good way to say it, but you could also say \"I don't feel the same way about you anymore\" if you want to be blunt.  Either way, when you break up with someone you usually end up hurting them, so you should always be sensitive to the other person's feelings.\n\nComment: @johnny What's the easy way?  The \"easy way\" is to just keep being with her.  (Unless there's a good reason not to, like \"I'm engaged to someone else\", or \"I'm not attracted to women\", or \"I'm leaving the country\".)\n\nComment: @johnny: It's always hard to say things like that.  And, like Shog9 says, it's always going to be hurtful.  If you're not sure you want to break up with her, then I suggest that you don't.  If you do, you should be as sensitive to her feelings as possible.  I don't know much about being a teenager, but I suspect that you're emotionally mature enough to understand that hurting people is not a nice thing to do.\n\nComment: @johnny - I'm not a teenager, I'm a girl, and I say: don't break up with her.  Not if you are going to feel unhappy or guilty about it.  You haven't put any effort into your current relationship, so you don't deserve to be happy.  This is a time when you need to show her some love and appreciation, and you should put the energy into that rather than thinking about how to break up with her.\n\nComment: I know I should just be with her, but I feel like I'm being selfish just by being with her. I feel like I'm hurting her because I'm not in love with her.\n\nComment: @johnny - I'm not a teenager either, but I am a girlfriend, and I can tell you that if you think you are hurting me by being with me, then it is a certainty that I am hurting you by being with you.  I don't want to be with someone who is not happy with me.  I want to be with someone who loves me and appreciates me.  I don't want to be with someone who wants to break up with me.  If you feel like you're being selfish, then you should do the selfish thing and break up with me without hurting my feelings.  I'd rather you break up with me now than stay with me and grow unhappy.\n\nComment: @johnny - if you are only with your girlfriend because you think it will be easier than breaking up with her, you are wrong.  It will be harder.  If you are only with your girlfriend because you feel like you are being selfish about it, then you are right, you are being selfish.  You are being selfish by not being honest with her about how you feel, and you are being selfish for staying with her when you don't love her enough.\n\nComment: @johnny - I don't know what you look like, but I'm a good-looking girl.  I don't know how old you are, but I'm 19.  I don't know if you are in love with someone else, but if you are, then you are being selfish to stay with me just to make it easier for yourself.  If you think that I will be hurt by your breaking up with me, then I am hurt by you staying with me.  If you are not in love with me, then you should break up with me and move on.  If you are in love with me, then tell me so, and we can work it out.

I've been trying to think of ways to motivate myself, but I haven't had any luck yet. Any ideas?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI don't know your situation, but for me, I find that, when faced with an onerous task, I am best motivated by thinking of how good it will feel when I'm finished.\n\nFor example, I'm currently working on a project that is way behind schedule. I had a week scheduled for it, and I was only able to get about 30% done. It is taking me a week just to think about the problem, and I still don't know exactly what I need to do.\n\nI'm now looking at the rest of the week, which might be the last week I have to work on it, with the thought that, if I can get 70% done, that will be a really great accomplishment.\n\nMy hope is that, if I can get to 70%, then I will have a better idea of what I need to do to get to 100%. If I can get to 100%, then I'll be finished with the project, and will be able to get on with my life.\n\nSo, even though I have no idea what I need to do, I am still motivated by the thought that, if I can get to 70%, then I'll be a lot closer to 100%, and to completion.\n\nAnswer: One thing that really helped me was to set up a reward for myself when I finished a project.  Usually this was a \"treat\" that I would have been buying anyway if I didn't need an incentive, but it made the process of finishing a project seem more worthwhile.\n\nOne time I was working on a project that was really boring, and I was trying to figure out how to motivate myself.  I got the idea to buy myself an Xbox 360 when I finished the project, and that did the trick.  When I started working on the project, I couldn't even imagine having the time to play video games again, but I made myself finish the project.  I was able to get through the boring part much more quickly than I would have otherwise, and once I was done I was able to reward myself.", "I would suggest a number of things:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You might go to the library and study with people.\n\\item Or perhaps find a friend to help you stay accountable.\n\\item Perhaps find a tutor.\n\\item Maybe read some books and/or articles on how to motivate yourself.\n\\item Maybe work on developing some self-compassion.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI hope this is helpful!\n\nComment: Thank you so much for your response!  I've been trying to do these things, but they're not working.  Maybe I need to try something different.

Are you not understanding the material? Are you bored?\n\nIf you are getting a bad grade, you need to study smarter.\n\nIf you are not understanding the material, you need to study harder.\n\nIf you are bored, you need to find a tutor who can explain the material in a way that you understand.\n\nIf you are struggling, you need to find a tutor who can help you understand the material.", "I would try to change your schedule so that you have more time to sleep. Also, try to take short naps during the day.\n\nAnswer: I would suggest that you write down your daily tasks in a small notebook, and set goals for them.  For example, if your goal is to read 50 pages a day, write it in the notebook.  Then you can check it off as you go.  When you don't accomplish the goal, write down the reason why.\n\nAnswer: I would suggest that you start a rewards program for yourself.  Give yourself a goal of say writing 50 pages and everyday that you achieve the goal, reward yourself with some time doing something you enjoy.\n\nAnswer: I'm a student too, so I know what it's like. If your main problem is actually falling asleep, I would try not taking caffeine before bed and not watching TV or anything else that might stimulate your brain. If that doesn't work, I would try taking a vitamin B-complex or drinking a cup of tea with milk before bed. I find that helps me sleep.\n\nAnswer: I know that this is a really old question, but I just want to add my two cents.\n\nI'm not a student, but I've had the same problem that you have. I have recently started to take a B-complex every day, and I also take a melatonin pill 30 minutes before I go to bed. I also make sure to turn off all electronics at least an hour before I go to bed. I also make sure to get at least 7 hours of sleep a day.\n\nHope this helps!"]}

Not the student? If so, I will have to look for a job immediately I graduate.\n\nComment: @user119615: That's a separate question altogether. There are no tuition fees in the UK, right? And the universities don't pay anything, right?\n\nComment: In the UK, students pay tuition fees, but the government pays for the first \u00a39000 of the tuition fees.\n\nComment: @user119615: I see. I don't really know how it works in the UK. I'm assuming that the university pays for the extra year of study, but I could be completely wrong.\n\nComment: @user119615: Actually, I just looked up the [student finance guide](http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/EducationAndLearning/StudentFinance/StudentsFromEngland/DG_4020334) and it looks like the government will pay for part of the extra year of study as well.\n\nAnswer: The industry year is the best way to get a feel of the work environment and to get a job after graduation.", "I would recommend it 100%.\n\nI'm a PhD student, and I did a year in industry before that. I did a PhD in the first-order [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of a language, and a master's thesis on [Dutch-book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_book#Definition) arguments in finance.\n\nTo be honest, I found the industry experience more useful than either of those things.\n\nDuring that year I worked for a firm which developed a trading platform for online gambling. The work was challenging, and I had a lot of freedom.\n\nIn retrospect, I can see that the work I did was closely related to a PhD in programming languages, specifically the area of \"type systems\".\n\nFor example, I developed a system for [type inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_inference) for a [typing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) that had multiple kinds of types (e.g. numeric, string, boolean). I also developed a [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tool for the language.\n\nAt the end of the year I was able to present the work I had done to the other developers, and the management team.\n\nI would recommend a year in industry to any undergraduate computer science student.\n\nAnswer: I think it would be a great idea, but it may depend on what you would like to do with your degree. If you are interested in the theoretical side of CS then a year in industry may not be as beneficial as it would be for someone more interested in the practical side.\n\nHaving said that, I would suggest you get in contact with a local company that you might be interested in working for. If you are lucky they may be able to offer you a year in industry as part of your degree. This is often the case in my area as the local universities have links with local companies to provide work experience and internships.\n\nIf no such scheme is offered by your university, then you may want to think about finding a company yourself and approaching them for a placement. If you can show that you are capable of doing interesting things then a company may be interested in offering you a placement.\n\nSo in summary, I would say yes do it - but do it as part of your degree.\n\nComment: I have no experience in industry but I think it is inevitable that you would learn more. In theory, you would be learning from doing, rather than from reading a book.\n\nAnswer: In my opinion a year in industry is a must. You will learn so much more in a real world environment. For example, I started my career as a web developer and did a masters in web development but my employers gave me enough training to get a good grasp of the subject. I was given projects to work on where I had to learn a lot of new technologies. When I joined a company to work on C# projects I had to learn C#.  I was given a project to work on and had to learn how to use SQL server to generate reports.\n\nA lot of the work that I did in my masters degree was theoretical but in the industry I had to apply that knowledge to real world problems.\n\nYou will get so much more from a placement than you will from a year in college.\n\nAnswer: I would recommend it based on my own experience. I did my undergrad in CS and took a year in industry.\n\nThe benefits that I saw are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item it makes you more employable.\n\\item you will learn things that you won't learn from a textbook.\n\\item it will help you to choose the right direction for your career.\n\\end{itemize}", "If you are a good student, you should definitely try to get a year in industry. It is good for your CV, it improves your employability, and it is a good experience.\n\nYou should also take the opportunity to ask for a reference, as having a reference from an industrial employer will be useful.", "The main point is that a year in industry gives you experience and a degree, whereas a year out gives you experience and no degree.\n\nHowever, a year out is not always a problem, especially if you can go abroad and do something related to your course. Even a year in industry can be a waste. If you can get a good job in a field related to your degree, then it's a good move, but if it's a job that involves doing something that you don't want to be doing for the rest of your life, then it's a waste.\n\nComment: So it is true that I will have more experience with a year in industry than without, but I could still be doing something I do not like.\n\nComment: Yes. I'm not saying that a year in industry is always a good idea. I'm saying that a year out is not necessarily a problem.\n\nComment: I guess the question is how to determine whether a job is the kind of thing you want to do for the rest of your life, if you don't know anything about it.\n\nComment: That's exactly what I'm saying. I don't know what you want to do for the rest of your life, but you should know what you want to be doing in 5 years time. I did a year in industry myself, and it was worthwhile because it showed me that I liked the industry I was in, but didn't want to continue in it.\n\nAnswer: A year in industry is good if you want to do a PhD or research. If you want to go to work after university, it's better to do a paid internship in a lab.\n\nI did a year in industry and it was not useful.\n\nAnswer: I think it really depends on the industry you are in (and what you are doing) and how many years of experience you need in order to be qualified to do a PhD.\n\nWhile I was an undergraduate I did a Masters in Computing where for the final year you were expected to spend a year at a company. In the end I found I was not suited for a career in IT and decided to do a PhD instead.\n\nAt my interview I mentioned that I had done my year in industry and they commented that it was good that I had had some experience in the industry.\n\nComment: I'm not sure about the PhD bit. I don't think it is any advantage at all."]}

I've been trying to figure it out, but I'm not very good at math. Do you have any tips for me?\n\nComment: @Kate The script multiplies the number $n by itself $n times. Each time it does that, it increases the value of $n by 1. So, in the first loop, it multiplies the initial value of $n by itself, which is $n^2$. Then, it increases the value of $n by 1, so the next loop will be $n^3$. In the third loop, it will be $n^4$, and so on. You can see that the value of $n will increase by a power of 2 each time, so it will take 100 loops to output 47,000.\n\nComment: Thank you for your help! I think I understand it now. What a neat way to use math to solve a problem.\n\nAnswer: A script that calculates the number of loops needed to output $n.\n\n\\begin{code}\n$n = 1;\n$n *= $n;\n$n++;\n\n$i = 1;\nwhile($n <= 100) {\n    $n *= $n;\n    $n++;\n    $i++;\n}\necho $i;\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will take about 100 loops to output 47,000.\n\n\\begin{code}\n$n = 1;\n$n *= $n;\n$n++;\n\n$i = 1;\nwhile($n <= 100) {\n    $n *= $n;\n    $n++;\n    $i++;\n}\necho $i;\n\\end{code}\n\nYou can see that it took 100 loops to output 47,000.\n\nAnswer: The following script will output 47000 in 100 loops.\n\n\\begin{code}\n$n = 1;\nwhile($n <= 100) {\n    $n *= $n;\n    $n++;\n}\necho $n;\n\\end{code}\n\nThis is because the number of loops needed to output $n is equal to the number of times $n needs to be multiplied by itself. In this case, it needs to be multiplied by itself 47000 times, which takes 100 loops.\n\nThank you for your help! I think I understand it now.

This is when the universe was small enough to be described by general relativity and quantum physics.\n\nThe best model for the early universe is the Big Bang model. This is a very good model for the early universe.\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer. That was exactly what I was looking for.", "For a start I would look at the [Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) and on the [NASA site](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/bb_theory_bb_theory.html)\n\nThe first thing to understand is that it does not mean that the universe started as one single point in space and time and then exploded outwards. Instead the idea was that the universe was unimaginably dense and started to expand.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the Universe which is supported by astronomical observation and experiment. According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe was in an extremely hot and dense state a very long time ago, and has been expanding and cooling ever since. The theory is based on two fundamental observations:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the red shift of galaxies, and\n\\item the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThese observations were made at the start of the twentieth century. The red shift of galaxies was observed in 1912 by Vesto Slipher, and the cosmic microwave background radiation was discovered by Robert Wilson and Arno Penzias in 1964. The Big Bang theory was developed between 1920 and 1940 by George Lema\u00eetre, Georges Lema\u00eetre, Alexander Friedmann, and Alan Guth.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is not the only cosmological model of the Universe. Another model, called the Steady State Theory, was developed in the 1940s and 1950s, and it was thought to be a viable alternative to the Big Bang theory until the 1960s. However, by the late 1960s, the Big Bang theory had become the dominant cosmological model.\n\nThe Big Bang theory is supported by a wide range of observations. These include the red shift of galaxies, the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large scale structure of the Universe, the abundance of light elements, and the age of the Universe.\n\nThe Big Bang theory has been very successful in explaining a wide range of observations, and it is now the dominant cosmological model. However, there are still some aspects of the Universe that are not well explained by the Big Bang theory. These include the origin of dark matter, the origin of dark energy, and the origin of the Universe's large scale structure.\n\nAnswer: The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing theory to explain the origin of the universe. It states that the universe began as a singularity, a single, infinitely dense point in space, which then expanded and cooled. This expansion and cooling created the universe as we know it today, with stars, galaxies, and everything else.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory is supported by a number of observations, including the red shift of galaxies (which can be explained by the expansion of the universe), the cosmic microwave background radiation (which is believed to be a remnant of the Big Bang), and the abundance of light elements (which can be explained by nucleosynthesis in the early universe).\n\nThe theory has been criticized for a number of reasons, including the \"flatness problem\" (the fact that the universe's density is very close to the critical density needed for a flat universe) and the \"horizon problem\" (the fact that the universe is too large for the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation to have been homogenized by thermal radiation). However, these problems can be explained by more complex versions of the Big Bang Theory, such as inflationary cosmology.\n\nAnswer: There is a very simple, yet very powerful, experiment that supports the Big Bang theory.\n\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is evidence of the Big Bang.\n\nComment: This is a nice answer, but it would be a good idea to expand it a little.  You could mention the effect of the CMBR on the early universe, and how it is the best observational evidence for the Big Bang.  The CMBR is also a tool for studying the universe's history.  But it is easy to make statements about the CMBR that are not correct, so it is important to be careful.\n\nComment: Well, I'm not a cosmologist.  I'm a software engineer and I know very little about cosmology.  So I don't think that I could do it justice.\n\nAnswer: It's a theory, not a fact.  It's the best explanation we", "The Big Bang as a cosmological model was first formulated in 1927 by George Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian Roman Catholic priest, as a solution to Einstein's field equations of general relativity. The idea that the universe had a beginning is older, and was first proposed by the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann in 1922.\n\nThe Big Bang model accounts for the observed ratio of the abundance of the light elements deuterium, helium-3 and helium-4 to hydrogen in the universe. It also explains the isotropy and uniformity of the universe. These observations were the first evidence for the Big Bang model.\n\nThe Big Bang model is supported by other observations, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, and measurements of the Hubble constant.\n\nAnswer: Here is a link to [the Wikipedia page on the Big Bang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang).\n\nComment: I think it would be best if you posted a bit of the information here, just in case that link dies.\n\nAnswer: The Big Bang is the theory that our universe was created from a singularity in the past. No one knows for sure when or how it happened, but scientists have some theories.\n\nAnswer: The Big Bang is the theory that our universe began as a singularity, which then expanded and cooled. This is the best explanation for the expansion of the universe, among others.\n\nComment: \"The best\" is a pretty strong statement to make.  As it is, the scientific community is split on whether the Big Bang is the \"best\".  The Big Bang is certainly a popular theory, but to proclaim it the \"best\" is to say that all other explanations are wrong.  I don't think anyone knows for sure.\n\nComment: I'm not saying it's the best explanation, what I am saying is that it's the best theory that explains the expansion of the universe.\n\nComment: I think you should re-read your own answer.

Was it a single event or a series of events?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt is generally assumed that there was a singularity at the beginning of time. However, the exact nature of this singularity is not known, and there are a few different ideas regarding it. Some of the ideas are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The universe may have been \"created\" from a singularity.\n\\item There may have been a \"quantum fluctuation\" in which the universe appeared from nothing.\n\\item A \"meta-universe\" was created, and our universe is just one of many.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat was the universe before this happened?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is an interesting question, and I don't think anyone knows for sure. There are a few different theories, but I'll just list one. The idea is that the universe was created \"from nothing\". That is, the quantum fluctuation I mentioned before occurred. The energy density of the fluctuation could be either positive or negative. In the positive case, you have a singularity which expands and becomes our universe. But what if it was negative? In that case, we would have the Big Bang, but we would never have seen it. A lot of people don't like this idea, as it sort of violates the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat were the laws of physics before this happened?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nTo my knowledge, we don't know what the laws of physics were before the Big Bang.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat was the composition of the universe before this happened?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWe don't know what the composition of the universe was before the Big Bang.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat is the composition of the universe like now?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe composition of the universe is mostly what we call \"dark energy\".\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nHow do we know the Big Bang happened?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe Big Bang is the best theory to describe the current state of the universe.

Neither of these are team games.\n\nThe first one is a \\em{bluffing} game. The roles are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The Werewolf\n\\item The Seer\n\\item The Villagers\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe second one is a \\em{strategy} game. The roles are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The President\n\\item The Ministers\n\\item The Nations\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWerewolf is a lot more enjoyable and it's much shorter. It only takes about 15 minutes to complete. Also, it's a lot easier to find the rules.\n\n\\section{Rules}\n\nThe game is played in rounds.\n\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The game starts with the selection of a moderator (a referee).\n\\item The moderator distributes the roles to the players.\n\\item Players talk in private for a little while to form an alliance. When they agree, the moderator starts the game.\n\\item Each round, the \\em{werewolf} kills a player.\n\\item The \\em{seer} discovers the \\em{werewolf} and tells the moderator.\n\\item The moderator checks which player is the \\em{werewolf} by counting the votes.\n\\item If the moderator is not sure, he might ask for another vote.\n\\item The moderator announces the result.\n\\item The game ends when there are two players left: the \\em{werewolf} and a \\em{villager}.\n\\item If it's the \\em{villager}, the game ends and the \\em{villager} wins. If it's the \\em{werewolf}, the game ends and the \\em{werewolf} wins.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Voting}\n\nThe voting is done by raising hands. The moderator counts the votes and checks if a majority is reached.\n\nAs an example, let's say that there are 3 players. The moderator distributes the roles as follows: \\em{werewolf}, \\em{seer}, \\em{villager}.\n\n\\em{Werewolf} knows that it's him. The other two players know that they are \\em{villagers}.\n\n\\em{Seer} knows who the \\em{werewolf} is.\n\nThe moderator asks the players to vote for the player that they think is the \\em{werewolf}.\n\n\\em{Villager 1} is sure that \\em{Villager 2} is the \\em{werewolf}.\n\n\\em{Villager 2} is sure that \\em{Werewolf} is the \\em{werewolf}.\n\n\\em{Werewolf} agrees with \\em{Villager 2}.\n\n\\em{Seer} knows that \\em{Werewolf} is the \\em{werewolf}.\n\nThe moderator counts the votes. There are two votes for \\em{Villager 2} and one vote for \\em{Werewolf}.\n\nThe moderator announces the result and kills \\em{Villager 2}.\n\n\\strong{Strategy}\n\nThe game is a bluffing game, which means that you have to lie.\n\n\\em{Werewolf} has to lie to the \\em{villagers} and convince them that the other player is the \\em{werewolf}.\n\n\\em{Villagers} have to lie to \\em{Werewolf} to convince him that they are \\em{villagers} and not the \\em{werewolf}.\n\n\\em{Seer} has to lie to \\em{Werewolf}.\n\nThe game ends when there are two players left: \\em{werew", "\\section{[Scrabble](https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us)}\n\nScrabble is a game where players take turns putting tiles on a board to create words.

The thing about clubs is that you have to go to meetings, and you have to participate.  It can be hard to go to meetings at the same time each week, but that's the deal.  I would say clubs are best for people that are reasonably extroverted.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat are the most effective ways to meet people?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWell, this is more of a social skill question, so I would say you should start by asking people you find interesting.  This can be hard, because people can be shy, but if you are comfortable asking questions that's a good start.  You can also try joining an activity or a club.  Some clubs are more social than others.  If you want to try to meet some people that are like-minded, you can try looking for a club based on the kind of things you like to do.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI've tried a lot of clubs and activities, but I'm not making any friends.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWell, that's not great.  First, what kinds of clubs and activities have you tried?  Have you tried any that are more social?  You can always try something social that you think you might like.  Maybe you could try joining a sports team, or a group that does something active.  You could also try meeting people in person by joining a group that meets to do something you like.  You could try something like a board gaming club, or a writing club, or a club that does a hobby you like.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI'm not very good at making small talk.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWell, I think this is a bit of a common problem, and I think it's kind of hard to get good at.  The thing is, small talk isn't really about small talk.  It's about getting to know someone, and finding things that you have in common.  I would say the best way to get good at small talk is to practice.  You can practice by talking to random people, but I think it's better to pick a few people that you might find interesting, and talk to them.  You can try to find something that you like in common, and ask questions about that.  It's all about finding a way to connect.  You can also try to practice by talking to people online.\n\nComment: I think the best way to make friends is to join a group that has a common interest. I know people who joined a book club and made friends.\n\nComment: @Tina I've found this to be true as well.\n\nComment: I think I\u2019ll try joining a club and see if it helps. Thanks!\n\nComment: @KaaylaC I think that's a good plan.  I think it's also important to join a club that you think you will like.  You could also try joining a group that meets in person that has a common interest, like a writing club, or a book club, or a board gaming club.\n\nAnswer: I am a bit of an introvert and I have a hard time with small talk. I did a course on TED Ed called [How to have a conversation](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-have-a-conversation-nathan-pearson). I found this really useful. I recommend you watch the video and read the notes.\n\nI'm doing the following and it's working for me:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item I'm joining a club in my apartment block.\n\\item I'm going to the pool and chatting with people waiting in line.\n\\item I'm joining a board gaming club.\n\\item I'm playing a tabletop role playing game.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: I'm a big introvert too and I find it hard to make small talk. I'm going to try the things you've said. Thanks!\n\nAnswer: I would suggest learning how to get along with people. There are many ways to do this. I am a socially awkward person myself. I have found that practicing social skills with other people has worked for me.\n\nComment: I try to get along with people, but I'", "Hi. I think there are 2 types of friends.\n\n1. Friends that you've known since you were young.\n\n2. Friends that you've met later in your life.\n\nIn my opinion, you shouldn't only focus on the first type of friends.\n\nBecause there are so many people around, and you'll never know who you might be friends with.\n\nAnd, it's not easy to meet new friends these days, because the world is so different now.\n\nYou've got to try to find friends by yourself.\n\nFor example, you could try to make friends at your school, or at a new hobby that you've started.\n\nIf there is someone at school/your hobby that you like, try to get to know that person better.\n\nAsk them to hang out sometime, and maybe you'll become friends.\n\nBut, if you've done that, and haven't found any friends, then it's a bit awkward.\n\nIn that case, you can try to make new friends online.\n\nThere are many websites like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube...\n\nYou can make new friends by using social media.\n\nBut, I think it's best if you can make new friends in real life.\n\nBecause you'll feel so much better when you're with your friends, compared to when you're alone.\n\nHope you make new friends soon.\n\nAnswer: I think you should find an interest that you enjoy and you can meet new friends through that. For example, I love books, so I joined a book club. I also joined a gym and I found a lot of people similar to me there. I wish you the best of luck!\n\nAnswer: I think you should join a group with same interest, like singing group, dancing group, sports club or anything else. It will be easy to meet new friends."]}

It's important to get one that is designed for your specific needs.\n\nAnswer: There is a variety of air purifiers on the market today, and it can be hard to know which one is right for you.  Here are some things you should consider when choosing an air purifier.\n\n\\strong{Why do you need an air purifier?}\n\nAir purifiers can help reduce odors in the air and improve indoor air quality.  They can also help reduce airborne allergens and particles.\n\n\\strong{What type of air purifier do you need?}\n\nThere are several types of air purifiers on the market, including HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters, carbon filters, ionizers, and UV (ultraviolet) light.  HEPA filters are the most popular type of air purifier and are designed to remove the most particles from the air.\n\n\\strong{Do you need a HEPA filter?}\n\nIf you're looking for an air purifier to remove allergens and particles from the air, a HEPA filter is the best option.  Other types of air purifiers, such as carbon filters, ionizers, and UV light, may not be as effective at removing these particles.\n\n\\strong{How much will it cost?}\n\nAir purifiers can range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.  The price depends on the type of air purifier you choose and the features it offers.\n\n\\strong{Where will you use it?}\n\nAir purifiers can be used in a variety of places, including your home, office, and car.  Make sure to choose an air purifier that is designed for the space where you plan to use it.\n\n\\strong{How often will you use it?}\n\nThe more often you use an air purifier, the better it will be at removing particles from the air.  Make sure to choose an air purifier that is designed for the amount of use you plan to get out of it.\n\n\\strong{How easy is it to use?}\n\nSome air purifiers are easy to use, while others require a bit of setup.  Make sure to choose an air purifier that is easy to use and that you will be comfortable using.\n\n\\strong{What are the features?}\n\nAir purifiers can come with a variety of features, including an ionizer, a UV light, and a timer.  Make sure to choose an air purifier that has the features you need.\n\n\\strong{What is the warranty?}\n\nMost air purifiers come with a warranty, but the length of the warranty can vary.  Make sure to choose an air purifier that has a warranty that meets your needs", "The key words in your question are \"smells bad\".\n\nI would suggest you buy an air purifier (e.g. [Fellowes AP-100](http://www.amazon.com/Fellowes-AP-100-Air-Purifier-Ionizer/dp/B00010T1EK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=industrial&qid=1231481470&sr=8-1)) and run it for a while. If it doesn't help, you should consider doing a more detailed analysis of the air and finding the source of the problem.\n\nAnswer: If you have a problem with the air in your apartment, the first thing you should do is to try to find the source of the problem. Is it something you can see in your home (like a moldy shower, or a rotten apple left in a drawer, or a dead mouse in the wall) or is it a problem with your neighbors? If it's the former, then it's a fairly simple task of cleaning up the source.\n\nIf it's the latter, then you need to try to find a way to solve the problem. If your neighbors smoke, then you'll need to find a way to keep the smoke out of your apartment. If there's a problem with the heating system, then you need to find a way to get the landlord to fix it.\n\nIf the problem is from something you can't see or fix, then you'll need to find a way to filter the air in your apartment.

What is a good way to purify the air in my home?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAir purifiers work by passing air through a filter. They work best when the filter is clean, and you would have to change the filters often, and for some types of filters, they need to be changed monthly.\n\nThere are also ionic air purifiers that work by emitting a small electrical charge to air molecules to which they would then attach. This makes them heavier and fall to the ground to be collected by the filter.\n\nIonic air purifiers don't use filters, but they need to be washed often and the electrical charge will need to be re-applied often.\n\nSome air purifiers combine both filter and ionic technologies.\n\nWith that said, I would recommend an ionic air purifier as it is the easiest to maintain.\n\nComment: I am currently living in Manhattan, but I will be moving to a house in a week. Do I need to get a different kind of air purifier?\n\nComment: @JimClarke  Not necessarily.  Some air purifiers are better than others.

The week before Thanksgiving can be very expensive and crowded due to the holiday.

For an even better deal, stay in a hotel that is an hour away and drive in.\n\nComment: I agree with @Jeff.  Disney's own hotels are expensive.  The prices are lower during the week and there are many reasonably priced hotels within an hour's drive of Disney.\n\nComment: I'm not sure if it's still a thing, but Disney has a military discount for families.\n\nAnswer: The cheapest times would be early January and just after Labor Day. These are the worst times for crowds. Another good time would be late April/early May but you have to be prepared to deal with the crowds and weather, especially at Epcot.\n\nComment: I agree with @Jeff.  The parks are very crowded during school vacations.  Even though the crowds are smaller during the first week of January, you will have to deal with the heat and the crowds on New Year's Day.\n\nAnswer: If you are in the US, Memorial Day and Labor Day are likely to be the least expensive times. However, you may have to deal with larger crowds and higher temperatures. The end of September is also a good time to visit.\n\nIf you have children in school, be careful of the week after spring break. The parks are usually packed during this time.\n\nAnswer: If cost is a big concern, consider visiting during the summer or end of the year.  The weather will be unbearable or the parks are closed for the holidays.\n\nIf you want to spend the most money, go for a visit during the week of spring break or the week of Christmas.  You can expect to pay top dollar, but there will be plenty of entertainment and activities going on.\n\nAnswer: As others said: summer and winter are the cheapest.\n\nBut, in my opinion, the best time to visit is the week after Labor day. The weather is perfect, crowds are not too bad (not as bad as after Labor Day) and the parks are open (not as open as a week after Labor Day).\n\nI don't know if there is a big difference in hotel prices or not, but I have not seen any big difference (I have been to Disney about 20 times)\n\nBest of luck.", "That is a good question.  I have a post that I wrote on this subject.\n\nhttp://www.disneyworldatlanta.com/2009/05/best-time-to-go-to-disney-world-and.html\n\nBasically, I recommend going on the week after Christmas.  The crowds are still there, but the prices are still low.  It is fun to see the decorations still up and all the Christmas trees in the hotels.  I think that is the best time to go to Disney World.\n\nComment: I can't even begin to imagine how much work it must of been to put all those twinkle lights on Cinderella's Castle\n\nComment: I have no idea how much work it was, but I can imagine what it would do to my electric bill.\n\nAnswer: I would say early December, when they're still putting up decorations but the crowds aren't so huge.\n\nComment: This is the time of year I recommend as well.  It's kind of a toss up between the week after Christmas and the week before Halloween, but I think the Christmas decorations are a bit of a draw, especially for the young kids.\n\nAnswer: If you're after the cheapest deals, look in the middle of the week, and avoid holidays and public school holidays.\n\nIf you're after a great time, go for the week before Christmas (although this year, due to the economic climate, the parks may be less busy if you go on the week after Christmas).\n\nIt's also worth noting that the parks are generally less busy in the morning and evening, so you may wish to consider staying in a hotel that allows you early entry to the park (ie. the ones that allow you to enter the park an hour before it opens to the general public) so you can make the most of the quiet hours, and then come back in the evening when the crowds die down a little.\n\nComment: This is an interesting point.  I live in the Orlando area, so I don't have to worry about hotels with early entry, but I think it is very important for those visiting from out of state.  I think it is a great idea to go to the parks early and to come back at night.  The parks are much less crowded and you can do much more in a shorter period of time.\n\nComment: I agree with the early start, but the evening is best if you can swing it.  The morning is when all the characters come out, so you will be waiting in long lines for a few photos.  And it is extremely hot in the afternoon.\n\nComment: Evening is better for me because I can't get up too early, but morning is better for my 3 year old.  The crowds are very different in the morning and the evening.  Morning is a lot more crowded, and you have to wait much longer in line for the characters. In the evening, the crowds are a lot less and there really aren't any lines for the characters.\n\nComment: I've never had to wait in a line to meet a character, either morning or evening.  I've often seen the long lines in the morning, but never actually been in one.  When I was a kid, my brother and I used to go to the parks when they opened, and we'd always get to meet Mickey and Minnie and Goofy before the crowds got there, and that was over 30 years ago.\n\nComment: I think it depends on when you go.  I go in the summer, and the lines are incredibly long.  I've waited 30-40 minutes in line to meet Mickey or Minnie in the morning.  It is worth it, because I don't want to stand in the sun all day.  I really like the evenings, because the weather is nice and I can walk around.\n\nComment: I've never had to wait in a line to meet a character, either morning or evening.  I've often seen the long lines in the morning, but never actually been in one.\n\nComment: It is not the same as it was in the 80s, though.  There are still some characters that you can meet without waiting in line, but it is rare.  Most characters require a wait in the heat.\n\nAnswer: For me, the best time to go to Walt Disney World is during the off-season. This typically means January and February."]}

{"prompt": "How does the healthcare system work in the USA?", "response_list": ["Many states have registries of people who have been tested for HIV, and have agreed to have their records shared with others who have also agreed to share their records.  For example, the New York State HIV Registry (https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/aids/providers/registry/index.htm) allows anyone who is HIV-positive to enter their information into the registry.  Once they register, anyone who has also entered their information can view who is registered, and their latest HIV status.  The registry also allows people who are HIV-positive to enter the status of their partners (e.g. whether their partner is HIV-positive, and whether their partner is undetectable).  This allows people to find out whether their partner is HIV-positive, and whether their partner is undetectable, without having to ask their partner the question.\n\nThe advantage of having such a registry is that it allows an HIV-positive person to learn the status of their partner without having to ask their partner.  If you have to ask your partner, they will know that you are HIV-positive, and you have not told them that.  This can cause tension between you and your partner.  If you can learn the status of your partner without having to ask them, then you do not have to worry that your partner will find out that you are HIV-positive, and you do not have to worry that your partner might be upset that you did not tell them that you are HIV-positive.\n\nThe disadvantage of having such a registry is that if you do not want your partner to know that you are HIV-positive, and you do not want to share your HIV status with others, then you cannot use the New York State HIV Registry.  The New York State HIV Registry only allows people who are willing to share their HIV status with others to enter their information.\n\nComment: Interesting that you mention the registry in New York. I have always assumed this kind of thing was illegal, and I've never heard of it being done anywhere else.\n\nComment: @Ryan_L:  I have heard of this being done in other places, but I do not know of any other places where this is done.  I also do not know if this is legal or not.  I know that it is done, and I am not sure why it is done.  I am not sure if people register because they want to be registered, or because they have to be registered.  I do know that if you do not want to be registered, then you cannot be registered.", "Well, the healthcare system in the US is a bit complicated.\n\nYou have your healthcare insurance providers (Insurance companies), who determine the healthcare plans that they offer. These healthcare plans are basically what you buy from them, and they will pay for what is covered under the plan.\n\nThe healthcare plans vary between different insurance companies, but most of them cover 80% of the bill, the rest you have to pay.\n\nNow, you can choose which doctor you go to - the doctor will be part of a network that the insurance company has a contract with.\n\nAnd to visit the doctor, you have to make an appointment - the doctor will tell you how much you have to pay for the visit, and if you have healthcare insurance, the insurance company will pay for 80% of that visit and the rest you have to pay.\n\nSo, the healthcare system in the US is based on private insurance companies. The problem with this system is that there is no universal healthcare. So no one is guaranteed that they will be covered by healthcare insurance.\n\nPlus, there are people who do not have healthcare insurance, and they have to pay the full amount for their visits.\n\nThere are also people who have healthcare insurance, but their insurance coverage is not enough to cover all their bills.\n\nSo, the healthcare system in the US is not very good.

Most people get their insurance through their employers, although there are other options such as Medicare, Medicaid (which is for people with low income), and private insurance.  Many people also have supplemental insurance to cover expenses that regular insurance doesn't cover.  When someone gets an injury or gets sick, they go to a doctor or hospital, and the doctor or hospital sends the bill to the insurance company.  The insurance company will either pay the bill, or try to get the bill reduced.  If the insurance company doesn't pay, the doctor or hospital will send the bill to the patient.  If the bill is very large, the patient may be responsible for paying a portion of the bill.\n\nComment: So, I understand that this is a US-specific question, but it might be worth clarifying that your answer is only true for the US.

I'm just saying that it's useful to let them know that the US system works differently than theirs.", "This is a very broad question, I'll do my best to answer it for you.\n\nFirst of all, there is no one \"healthcare system\" in the US, there are many different options:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Employers often provide health insurance to their employees, and sometimes to their dependents, as part of their benefits package.\n\\item Many people get their health insurance from the government:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item People who are on Medicaid (low-income)\n\\item People who are on Medicare (over-65)\n\\item People who are on Tricare (military)\n\\item People who are on CHIP (low-income children)\n\\end{itemize}\n\\item Many people purchase their own health insurance, either on their own or through an employer.\n\\item People who cannot afford health insurance often don't have it.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe US has a very complicated healthcare system. Most of it is run by private companies for profit, but there are many public options like the ones above.\n\nComment: If I understand correctly, the most common option is private insurance?\n\nComment: Employer provided insurance is the most common option. [About 55% of people get their insurance from an employer.](http://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/#).\n\nComment: @luiscubal Yes, private insurance is the most common option, although the specifics depend on what you mean by \"private insurance\". The most common way people get private insurance is through their employer, but there are other ways too, like purchasing it individually and getting it through the government (Medicare and Medicaid, mainly).\n\nComment: Do I understand correctly that employers usually offer health insurance to their employees as a part of the benefits package?\n\nComment: @luiscubal Correct, for most employees it's part of their benefits package.\n\nAnswer: In the US, there is no single healthcare system.  The healthcare system can be divided into two categories, public and private, and there are several different ways to access healthcare in the US.\n\nThe public healthcare system in the US is mostly run by the federal government.  The largest public healthcare program is Medicare, which provides healthcare to individuals who are 65 years or older, as well as younger individuals with certain disabilities.  The next largest public healthcare program is Medicaid, which provides healthcare to low-income individuals.  The final large public healthcare program is the Veterans' Health Administration, which provides healthcare to veterans.  There are also public healthcare programs at the state level, such as Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which are partially funded by the federal government.\n\nThe private healthcare system in the US is made up of a variety of different types of healthcare providers, including hospitals, clinics, and doctor's offices.  In the US, most people get their healthcare through private health insurance companies.  These health insurance companies provide healthcare to individuals through a variety of different plans, such as HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations), PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations), and EPOs (Exclusive Provider Organizations).  Most people in the US get their health insurance through their employer, although some individuals also purchase health insurance directly from a health insurance company.\n\nAnswer: In the United States, healthcare is provided through a patchwork of state-run systems, private insurers, and employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\nThe most common way that people in the United States receive healthcare is through their employer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 55% of Americans get their health insurance through their employer.\n\nThe next most common way that Americans receive healthcare is through the government. About 19% of Americans are covered by Medicare, which provides healthcare to people who are 65 or older or who have certain disabilities. Another 21% of Americans are covered by Medicaid, which provides healthcare to low-income individuals and families.\n\nA small percentage of Americans are covered by private insurers. These insurers are regulated by the state in which they operate.\n\nAnswer: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question,", "The USA has the most expensive healthcare system in the world, and the most expensive health insurance. And it is not that good.\n\nThis is because of government interference in the market.\n\nFirst, you have to understand the basics of insurance. There are two parties involved in insurance:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The insurer. The company who pays you when you make a claim.\n\\item The insured. The person who buys insurance.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf you are in a 100% government run system, then the government is both the insurer and insured. This is the current situation in the UK.\n\nThe US government is the insurer of almost all the healthcare in the US, by means of Medicare and Medicaid, and Obamacare. These are government insurance programs for the poor and elderly. The government also subsidises premiums for people who buy private insurance.\n\nThe government is both the insurer and insured. This is unsustainable. The insurer is paying the insured, so the insurer must raise premiums to pay for the insured.\n\nPeople don't like to pay high premiums, so they demand that the government force the insurer to lower them. Thus, a death spiral begins.\n\nInsurance works best when the insured has skin in the game: they must pay part of the premium. This is why insurance is only effective for healthcare when the insured is not the insurer.\n\nThe solution to the current problem is to separate the insurer and insured. The government should stop paying for healthcare and take the money it wastes on it, and give the money back to the people. The government should stop forcing people to buy insurance.\n\nThen, people will be able to buy their own insurance, and the insurance companies will be able to set premiums according to risk. The people who are healthy will be able to get cheaper insurance, and the people who are sick can buy insurance for their particular condition.\n\nThis is how the insurance market works: insurance is only effective when the insurer is not the insured.\n\nComment: This is just so wrong. Health insurance is not a commodity. There are many health insurers in the US, and the health care system is not a monopoly. So, the premium for health insurance is the same for everyone, and the government subsidizes premiums for low income people. So, the government is not the insurer. Also, the health care system in the US is not a death spiral. The US has the best health care system in the world. And the health care system in the US is not collapsing. So, the US health care system is not a failure. Thanks for the link to NPR.\n\nComment: @user1530 The US has the highest per capita spending on healthcare in the world, and the worst health outcomes. That is the definition of a failure. https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/the-economic-impact-of-the-us-health-care-system\n\nComment: The US government is the insurer.

Web scraping is a method of extracting data from websites by using automated scripts. You can use a library such as [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape the website.\n\nAnother option is to use an API to access the information you need.

A high number of students could mean that the district is large or that there are many poor kids in the district.

The iPhone is unlikely to have changed much.\n\nThere will probably be another iPhone 17, but it will have a similar design to the iPhone 16.\n\nAnswer: It's impossible to predict what will happen in the future, but it's safe to say that there will be some changes in technology over the next 10 years. We may see advances in fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and quantum computing.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that these advances will not be as dramatic as we expect. So, while it may be possible to write an article about the iPhone 17 in 2025, it may not be as exciting as we hope.\n\nAnswer: We can safely assume that there will be an iPhone 17 in 2025. It is likely that it will be an improvement over the iPhone 16, and it is possible that it will have some new features or capabilities that are not available on the iPhone 16.

The iPhone 17 is a revolutionary phone with many new features that have never been seen before. It is the first phone to have a built-in artificial intelligence and it is capable of learning and understanding users' needs.\n\nThe phone is made of a new material called \"iSteel\", which is stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. It is also waterproof and can withstand up to 100 meters of water pressure.\n\nThe phone has a 6.5-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. It also has a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The phone is powered by a quad-core processor and has 4GB of RAM. It runs on the iOS 12 operating system.\n\nThe phone has a 3,100 mAh battery that can last up to two days on a single charge. It also supports fast charging and wireless charging.\n\nThe phone is available in three colors: black, white, and gold. It is available for pre-order now and will be released on September 12, 2018.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpE78.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nComment: Very good!

Or, you can use the JSON library to parse the data.  The JSON library allows you to parse it into a format that is easier to modify.\n\nComment: Yes, I'm aware of that, but I can't get it to work.

I know there are plenty of $150 flights from Chicago to New York, but the cheapest one I can find is $223.\n\nComment: @David: I'm not sure how much the OP knows about flying, so I was trying to be helpful.  I'm not sure that the OP knows that the cheapest flight to New York from Chicago might not be the cheapest flight to New York, period.  You are correct, however - the cheapest flight to New York from Chicago is $223.\n\nComment: @Mark: I think this is a good answer.  I don't think it is worth it to take a flight from Chicago to New York, and then take a flight from New York to Miami.

I'm just trying to help the OP as best I can.  Unfortunately, I don't think I am.\n\nComment: @David: I think that the OP is asking more for the cheapest way to get to Miami than the cheapest way from Chicago to New York.  He has a flight to New York, and wants to go from there to Miami as cheaply as possible.\n\nComment: @Mark: I'm not sure I agree.  The question states: **I'm leaving from Chicago and I will be flying to New York.**  He's only flying to New York because he has a flight from New York to Miami.  If he's asking how to get to Miami from Chicago, he should ask \"How can I get from Chicago to Miami as cheaply as possible?\" or \"How can I get from New York to Miami as cheaply as possible?\", not \"Are there any cheap tickets to New York from Chicago?\"\n\nComment: @David: I guess I'm interpreting the question differently.  To me, it's the cheapest way to get to Miami from Chicago, not the cheapest way to get to New York.  The OP clearly has a flight to New York, and he's asking how to get to Miami from there.  He's not asking how to get to New York.\n\nComment: @Mark: I guess it depends on the wording.  To me, it sounds like he's asking about getting to New York.  He states that he's leaving from Chicago and that he'll be flying to New York.  He never mentions Miami before that.  He then asks if there are any cheap tickets to New York.  It seems to me that the OP is asking about the cheapest way to get to New York from Chicago, not the cheapest way to get to Miami from Chicago.\n\nComment: @David: I guess it's a matter of interpretation.  The OP mentions that he is leaving from Chicago, and that he will be flying to New York.  He then asks if there are any cheap tickets to New York.  Since he is leaving from Chicago and flying to New York, I think it's fair to assume that he wants to know about the cheapest way to get to New York from Chicago.  As you mentioned, it's not clear - but it certainly isn't clear that he wants to know about the cheapest way to get to Miami from Chicago.\n\nComment: @Mark: I think the OP is asking about the cheapest way to get from New York to Miami, not the cheapest way to get from Chicago", "This question is pretty broad. The short answer is: yes.\n\nThe long answer is: it depends. First of all, there are a lot of different airports. If you are willing to travel to one that is farther from New York, you might be able to save a lot of money.\n\nSecond, you have to decide how much you're willing to spend. If you're only going to spend $250 total, you'll have to be flexible with the dates and times of the flights. There are flights that might be more expensive in the morning or evening, but are cheaper in the middle of the day.\n\nThird, you might be able to save more by booking two one-way tickets instead of a round trip. For example, if you wanted to go to New York, but didn't know when you were coming back, you might book a $100 one-way ticket from Chicago to New York and then book a $300 one-way ticket from New York to Chicago (or vice versa).\n\nFinally, you have to decide when you want to travel. If you're OK with traveling in the winter, you might be able to save money. If you want to travel during the summer, it's going to be more expensive.\n\nYou can use this website to search for cheap flights: https://www.cheapflights.com/flights-from-Chicago-to-New-York.html\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer.

{"prompt": "How can I improve my time management skills?", "response_list": ["I've had the same problem.\n\n\\strong{Solution:}\n\nI make a list of all my tasks for that day, and I write down how much time I think each task will take.  I then plan my day around the time slots that I have.\n\n\\strong{Advantage:}\n\nYou will have a good idea of how long everything will take.  If you finish early, you can go back and do things you didn't think you'd have time to do.  If you finish late, you'll know what tasks you wereted time on and which ones you didn't.\n\n\\strong{Disadvantage:}\n\nYou will have to do some research on how much time it really takes to do things.  But, it's worth it.\n\nComment: You should also have the discipline to stick to that plan.\n\nComment: +1 for discipline.  I've never been very good with that.\n\nAnswer: I have a very similar problem. I recently started using an accounting program called Yodlee MoneyCenter. It allows you to track your time and budget. It allows you to set goals for the amount of time you want to put toward different tasks (work, home, chores, etc). The program will alert you when you have exceeded your budgeted time for a task. I find it very helpful for keeping me on track.\n\nAnswer: I've found that the best way to do it is to have a daily plan and a weekly plan, and to do the daily planning first thing in the morning before you go into the office.\n\nYou need to decide what you're going to do each day and how much time you'll spend doing it, then plan your whole day accordingly.  It sounds obvious, but I find it's a lot easier to plan your day when you're not under pressure from other people.\n\nWhen I do it like this, I almost never have projects that run over time because I've already planned for them.  I usually leave myself at least 15 minutes at the end of each day to catch up on anything I've missed.\n\nAnswer: I have the very same problem and after years of struggling I have learned that the best solution is to divide my day in chunks. And I mean really small chunks.\n\nI always start my day with a single chunk. It's the chunk that I have to do today. I will decide what task I have to do and what I have to do today.\n\nThen I will give it a time. The time I will use for that task is the same time I use for everything. 10 minutes. 20 maybe.\n\nIt's extremely important that you stick to this. If you decide you will spend 10 minutes on a task you have to spend exactly that. Sometimes you'll be done in a few minutes, sometimes you'll be done in 20 minutes. It doesn't matter. You will not do more and you will not do less.\n\nYou can only do one thing at a time, so you can't be late on your next task because you were too quick on your previous task.\n\nAfter you have done your first task you will always have a new chunk.\n\nI know it sounds absurd, but it really works. I have done this for years and I can tell you it's the best solution I have found so far.\n\nComment: +1 for being specific about time.  I've never been able to stick to a time-based plan very well.\n\nAnswer: I've been working on this myself, and so far I've come up with two solutions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Prioritise.} If you can't get everything done, you need to prioritise. If you don't actually know what's important and what isn't, you need to figure that out.\n\\item \\strong{Timebox.} Give yourself a time limit for a task and stick to it. If you're doing this often, you can set a time limit for the whole day. Don't do more than your timebox limit for a task. If you do, try to shorten the time you spend on other tasks to make up for it.\n\\end{itemize}", "Here are some tips that helped me:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Make a to-do list of everything you need to do every day, including personal things like \"call mom\", \"buy groceries\" and so on.  It's very easy to forget to do these things, and you should at least make sure you do them every week.\n\\item Break down your to-do list into smaller tasks.  \"Clean room\" is a big task that might take hours.  \"Tidy up your clothes\" would be a smaller task.  \"Clean the floor\" would be a smaller task.  \"Do the dishes\" would be a smaller task.  In other words, you want to break down large tasks into smaller tasks.\n\\item Try to do the smaller tasks first, and the bigger tasks later.  It's easier to get a lot of small tasks done than a couple big ones.\n\\item Work on multiple tasks at once.  When you're waiting for something to finish, work on other things.  For example, if you're waiting for your computer to boot up, you can be working on your to-do list.\n\\item Plan ahead.  If you know you're going to be busy one day, do as much as possible the day before.  If you know you're going to be busy one week, do as much as possible that week.\n\\item Try to organize your time so that you're not too busy on certain days.  For example, if you know you're going to have a free day, you can work on bigger tasks that day.\n\\item When you're working on a task, try to think of ways to make it more efficient.  For example, can you batch-process multiple files instead of processing one file at a time?  Can you automate some tasks?\n\\item If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break.  Go for a walk, listen to some music, watch a movie, read a book, etc.  Do whatever relaxes you.  You'll be more productive when you come back.\n\\item Try to avoid multitasking.  It might seem like the best way to get things done, but it's actually very inefficient.  You'll get more done if you focus on one task at a time.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: Thank you @Wayne. I like your advice. I think I am doing most of the things you mentioned. However, I am still struggling to find solutions to my problem.\n\nComment: @AlexeyZimarev - Maybe you could try using a time management app like [Toggl](http://toggl.com/).  You could use it to track how much time you spend on different tasks.  That way, you can see where you're spending too much time (and where you're not spending enough time).\n\nComment: @Wayne: thanks, I will definitely try Toggl. I also found some time tracking software, for example [RescueTime](http://www.rescuetime.com/)\n\nComment: I think the most important piece of advice is to plan ahead. If you have a lot of stuff to do, try to figure out a way to do it in advance. If you can't, make sure you have some free time available to do it.\n\nComment: @WayneWerner - One more thing: when I'm overwhelmed, I just stop. I go for a walk, or do something else. It's better to take a break than to just push through it.\n\nComment: -1 Because it's a list of tips about how to organize your time. It doesn't answer the question.\n\nComment: @AlexeyZimarev I agree with you. I use the software \"RescueTime\" to track how I spend my time. It's a good tool.\n\nComment: @WayneWerner: I think it does answer the question. The question was \"How can I improve my time management skills?\" and I think my answer does that.", "I've been using a combination of tools and techniques to manage my time better.\n\nForemost, I use [TickTick](https://www.ticktick.com/) to keep track of my tasks and make sure I'm on schedule. I've found that having a central place to track my tasks and deadlines helps me stay organized and make sure I'm using my time effectively.\n\nIn addition to using TickTick, I also make use of the Pomodoro Technique to help me stay focused and on track. This involves breaking up my work into 25-minute chunks, with a 5-minute break in between each one. This helps me stay focused and avoid distractions, and also provides a sense of accomplishment as I complete each task.\n\nFinally, I make sure to take breaks throughout the day to help me stay energized and focused. I find that taking a few minutes to step away from my work and do something else helps me come back to my tasks with a fresh perspective and renewed energy.\n\nOverall, using a combination of tools and techniques has helped me manage my time better and get more done in less time. I hope this helps!", "I'm going to offer a slightly different approach.\n\nI've found that the time management techniques I learned in college, and from a couple of books on the subject, worked well for me for a while.  But eventually I decided that they were too prescriptive, and didn't fit my work patterns.  I found that I worked better under pressure, and that I was much more productive (and happier) when I just let myself work on whatever needed to be done, rather than trying to force myself to do things in a certain order.  I also found that trying to schedule everything was a bit overwhelming.\n\nIf you're not a very organized person (as I am not), maybe you could just do one thing at a time, and let the rest wait.  I don't think you need to be very organized to do this, but it helps if you can keep track of what you've done.  So you make a list, and you do whatever's easiest for you, and then you cross it off the list.  By the way, when you're done with something, you should always take a minute to decide which of the things you haven't done is the easiest and most meaningful thing to do next.  If there's more than one, just pick one.  And while you're doing that one thing, you should think about what you're going to do next.  That way you can decide in advance what the easiest thing to do next is.\n\nWhen you're done with that, you should think about which of the things you haven't done is the easiest and most meaningful thing to do next.  If there's more than one, just pick one.\n\nAnd so on.  The reason this works is that you're always working on the easiest thing you can do right now, so you're not spending a lot of time on things that are too hard for you.  And you're always working on the thing that's most meaningful to you right now, so you're not spending a lot of time on things that aren't meaningful to you.  And you're not trying to force yourself to do things in a certain order, which is really distracting, and it wastes time and makes you unhappy.\n\nThere's a lot of things I want to do, but I don't want to do them all right now.  So I keep them all in mind, and I do what I can when I can.  And I'm always thinking about what I can do next.  If I don't have anything else to do, I'll go back and do the next thing on my list.  But sometimes I'll think of something else that's more meaningful to me, and I'll do that instead.  That way, I'm always doing the thing that's most meaningful to me right now.\n\nThat's what I do.  It's not really a time management technique, it's just a way to get things done.  I find that I'm much more productive, and happier, when I let myself work on whatever I feel like working on right now, and when I don't force myself to do things in a certain order.  I also find that I'm much less stressed out when I don't have to force myself to do things in a certain order, and I feel like I have more control over my life.\n\nComment: I've found that this approach works better than others for me, but it's not the only one that works.  I would definitely not recommend this approach if you're not a very organized person, or if you're the kind of person who gets distracted easily, or if you're the kind of person who gets stressed out easily.  And I would not recommend this approach if you're not a very organized person, or if you're the kind of person who gets distracted easily, or if you're the kind of person who gets stressed out easily.

That's why", "You'll be amazed at how much more quickly you can get things done if you focus on one thing at a time.\n\nIf you can't focus on one thing, then you're just switching between tasks without actually doing anything.\n\nYou can't multitask.  You can only task switch, which is much less effective.\n\nAnswer: I'm with the others.  Focus on one thing at a time.  That's the best way to get it done.\n\nOne thing that I've found to help is to keep a list of things that I need to do.  I just have a text file in my home folder called 'Things to do.'  It's got a list of things that I need to do, and I try to prioritize them.\n\nWhen I get up in the morning, I look at the list.  I decide what the highest priority tasks are.  I start with those.  I also try to balance my list.  If I'm spending too much time on one type of item, I try to switch to something else.\n\nIt's good to keep a list.  I use a text file, but you can use any format.\n\nAnswer: I'll second the idea of making a daily todo list.  It's amazing how much I get done when I prioritize my day.  I tend to do things in the order of how important they are.  The stuff that I've been putting off for weeks sometimes gets done in a day.\n\nAlso, I don't go on the internet before doing my daily work.  That's my reward.  As soon as I finish my work for the day I spend an hour or so on the internet.  I might have an extra 20 min here and there, but I don't spend any significant amount of time on the internet until I've done my work for the day.\n\nAnswer: Make a list of what you need to do.  Make a list of things to do in the morning (get some exercise, fix breakfast, get dressed, etc).  Make a list of things to do during the work day (make calls, send emails, etc) and make a list for the evening (go home, make dinner, do housework, etc).  If you're like me, you'll get more done in a day if you have a plan.\n\nComment: I like this because it doesn't say \"Don't get distracted\".  It simply states that you should make a list of what you need to do (in other words, be sure you know what you need to do, and make a list).  If you know what you need to do, and you don't do it, then you would be wasting time.\n\nAnswer: The best way is to make a list of things you need to do in the next 24 hours, and then go through it, and do it one-by-one. It's important to keep this list handy, and go through it every 30 minutes or so.\n\nComment: I just started this, and it's amazing at how much I get done."]}

{"prompt": "How can I increase my productivity while working from home?", "response_list": ["The first step is to understand how you work best. Understand your own habits and what makes you most productive. For example, are you better working in a quiet environment, with a little bit of background noise, or with music playing? Do you work best with a blank wall (like an office wall) or with something on the wall to focus on?\n\nIf you find ways to work best, then you can use those to your advantage. For example, if background noise works best for you, then you can work in a coffee shop or near the kitchen where there is a constant background noise. And if you work best with a wall to focus on, then you can put a bulletin board up in your office to keep your mind focused on what the bulletin board is showing.\n\nAnswer: I'd like to provide another point of view, based on my own experience, which I think is a helpful one for a lot of people.\n\nI've found that, when working from home, one of the biggest productivity kills is the lack of routine.\n\nFor example, if you're used to working in an office, it's very likely that you have some sort of routine established. You probably know how to get to work, where to park, what to do when you get there, etc. This is a routine you've established over time, and it helps to get you in the right \"headspace\" to work.\n\nWhen you work from home, you're missing out on a big chunk of that routine. You don't have to wear a suit to work anymore, you don't have to get up early to catch your bus, etc. All of these things help to establish a routine, and when you're missing them, you're missing out on a big part of what helps you get into \"work\" mode.\n\nSo what I've done is that, while I'm at home, I try to establish my own routine. Even if it's a very small one. For example, I'll get up at the same time as I would if I was going to work, and I'll get myself dressed. I'll then make coffee and breakfast, as I would if I was going to work.\n\nThen, when I start working, I'll work in the same spot as I would in an office. This helps to establish a routine for me, and it helps me to get into \"work\" mode.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nComment: I would add - don't stay in your pajamas. Get dressed for work like you would if you were going to an office. That will help you mentally separate the two spaces.\n\nComment: I definitely agree with this.

There are things I can do at home that I \\strong{can't} do in an office.  But those things are not work and I do them at night or on the weekends.\n\nMy suggestion is to create a work environment at home that is as similar to the office environment as possible.  Get up early and get to work.  Put on some noise cancelling headphones, turn on some music, and start working.  Put your work clothes on, if you're used to wearing \"work clothes\" to the office.  Start working.\n\nIf you have a separate room for work that you can close the door on, that's even better.\n\nIf you get done with your work by 5:00, go home and relax.

I know that I'm less distracted by others in my workplace than I am by the TV and the cat.  +1\n\nComment: @Jason: I work from home and I'm having the same problem. I find that if I go out somewhere, I get more work done.\n\nComment: +1, this is dead on.  If I work from home, I get nothing done.  I have a home office and a work office, and I get much more done at the work office than I do in my home office.\n\nComment: I've seen it mentioned a few times now, but I think this answer is the best.  The more comfortable you are, the less you'll get done.  Aside from dressing for work and leaving the house, I'd add that you could try to get up early and work for a few hours before anyone else is awake.  Less people to distract you.\n\nAnswer: Turn off your internet connection.

Hawaii is the only U.S. state located outside North America. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean, southeast of the much larger island of Japan. Hawaii's natural beauty, warm tropical climate, inviting waters and waves, and active volcanoes make Hawaii a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists alike.\n\n\\strong{Hawaii's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be a bit less extreme due to near-constant trade winds from the east. Summer highs are usually in the upper 80s \u00b0F, (around 31 \u00b0C) during the day and mid 70s \u00b0F, (around 24 \u00b0C) at night. Winter day temperatures are usually in the low to mid 80s \u00b0F, (around 28 \u00b0C) and (night) temperatures in the upper 60s \u00b0F, (around 20 \u00b0C). Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at 4,205 metres (13,794 ft) on Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on Haleakala. Mount Wai\u02bbale\u02bbale, on Kaua\u02bbi, has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about 460 inches (11,684 mm).

Hawaii offers something for everyone.\n\n\\strong{Best time to snorkel in Hawaii}\n\nThe best time to snorkel in Hawaii is around May to October, during the summer months. This is the time of the year when the sea is calmer and warmer. The water temperature is around 22-27\u00b0C. It is also the time when marine life is very active.\n\n\\strong{Where to snorkel in Hawaii}\n\nThe best place to go snorkeling in Hawaii is the Waikiki Beach.

I would give each student a deck of cards and ask them to randomly deal five cards to each of the students.  I would then have each student play 30 hands of poker and record the results.  I would then have each student simulate 30 games of poker.  I would ask how many times did the student get a full house?  How many times did the student get four of a kind?  How many times did the student get a straight?  How many times did the student get a flush?  How many times did the student get three of a kind?  How many times did the student get two pair?

I did have one student who wrote a program that simulated the lottery.  The student could pick the numbers and see how many times they won.  I thought that was a great project.\n\nAnswer: I think that an important point to note is that you should be clear about what exactly you mean by \"chance\" or \"probability.\"  The students will only really understand the mathematical meaning of \"probability\" if you explicitly define what you mean by it.  I would suggest a simple definition:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe probability of some event $A$ is the relative frequency of that event when the experiment is repeated many, many times.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThen you simply give examples of events that can be repeated many times.", "Teaching probability is a hard topic.  It's one of the topics in which it's very easy to give a very good lecture, and have the students not learn a thing.  Thus, a lot of the \"lesson plans\" for probability are just some examples to show how it works, or maybe some examples of misinterpretations.  I'd recommend that you look up the various topics in probability:\n\n[Basic probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability#Basic_probability)\n\n[Conditional probability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability)\n\n[Independence and Bayes' Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_%28probability_theory%29)\n\n[Common probability distributions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions)\n\nand\n\n[Probability in everyday life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_in_everyday_life)\n\nWhen you teach something, it's good to have a mix between theory and examples.  The examples will make the topic more interesting, and give more concrete examples of how the theory can be applied.\n\nIf you want to see a good example, check out this video by MIT Professor Gilbert Strang:\n\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/21f/21f.027/prob_l1_lec1.html\n\nIt's from a class called Analysis on Manifolds, and it's a very good example of how to teach probability.  It starts out with some theoretical examples, and then goes to application.\n\nComment: Thanks for the lesson plan!", "There are three main points I would focus on:\n\n\\strong{1) What is a probability?}\n\nI would start with a basic question: what is a probability?\n\nI might ask the students what are some things that are always true. They might say things like \"2+2=4\" or \"the sum of the angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees\". Then I would ask them whether they thought that there are any things that are always false. They might say things that are obviously false, like \"5+2=3\".\n\nThen I would ask them whether there is anything that is always true, or always false, but cannot be proven. They might say \"the sun will rise tomorrow\", or \"the world will end in 2012\". I would then tell them that there are some things that are neither always true, nor always false, but sometimes true and sometimes false. I would then tell them that these things are called \"probabilities\" - things that are not certain, but have some chance of happening.\n\n\\strong{2) How do we calculate probabilities?}\n\nThe next thing I would do is to show how to calculate probabilities. For this I would use a simple example of flipping a coin.\n\nI would say that there are two possible outcomes - heads and tails. Then I would ask them how many ways there are to get each of those outcomes. They might say that there are 1 way to get a head, and 1 way to get a tail. This is how I would introduce the concept of permutations.\n\nThen I would ask them how many possible outcomes there are. They may say that there are two. I would then ask them how many ways there are to get both heads and tails. They might say that there is only 1 way to do that. This is how I would introduce the concept of combinations.\n\nThen I would ask them how many possible outcomes there are in total. They might say that the answer is 3. I would then ask them to figure out why the answer is 3 without using a calculator. They might say that there are 3 possible outcomes - heads, tails, and heads or tails.\n\nThis is how I would introduce the concept of counting.\n\n\\strong{3) How do we calculate probabilities for more complicated events?}\n\nThe next thing I would do is to show how to calculate probabilities for more complicated events. For this I would use the example of rolling two dice.\n\nI would say that there are 36 possible outcomes. Then I would ask them how many ways there are to get each of those possible outcomes. They might say that there are 6 ways to get a 1, 6 ways to get a 2, etc. This is how I would introduce the concept of permutations.\n\nThen I would ask them how many possible outcomes there are. They may say that there are 36. I would then ask them how many ways there are to get both a 1 and a 2. They might say that there is only 1 way to do that. This is how I would introduce the concept of combinations.\n\nThen I would ask them how many possible outcomes there are in total. They might say that the answer is 36. I would then ask them to figure out why the answer is 36 without using a calculator. They might say that there are 36 possible outcomes - 1, 2, ..., 6, 1+2, ..., 6+6.\n\nThis is how I would introduce the concept of counting.\n\n\\strong{Conclusion}\n\nI would end the lesson by asking them to think of some events that they might want to use probabilities for. Then I would ask them how they might figure out the probabilities for those events.\n\nComment: This isn't a complete answer, but you have the right idea.\n\nComment: +1 for giving a good introduction to counting and the idea of permutations and combinations.\n\nComment: I would suggest adding some example problems to the lesson plan to make it more complete\n\nComment: I might also mention that the number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of ways to get each outcome.\n\nComment: @GerryMyerson: Thanks! I think I'll add a few more examples.\n\nComment: @SJR: Good suggestion. I'll add a few more examples.\n\nComment: @Omnomnomnom: Thanks!

Agnon is considered the greatest writer in modern Hebrew literature. He wrote both novels and short stories, and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1966. His stories are set in eastern Europe, where he grew up, but also in Israel, where he lived beginning in 1924.\n\nTell students that they will read 2 short stories by Agnon.

Y. Agnon (Shmuel Yosef Agnon) were written in Hebrew, not Yiddish. I'm not sure if that makes any difference to your question.\n\nSecond, a lot of Agnon's work is available in translation, at least in English. The most accessible might be \\em{A Simple Story}, a novella about the Jews of Galicia in the late 18th century. (It's available from Tel Aviv University.)\n\nAgnon's best known work is probably \\em{Tmol Shilshom} (\"only in the shadow\"), a series of stories published between 1918 and 1959. The stories are linked by the character of Shimon the shoemaker and his shop in Jerusalem. They are available in English translation under the title \\em{Only Yesterday}.\n\nI would recommend starting with one of the stories, such as \"The Guests of the Tongue,\" which is a story about Yiddish. It is accessible and funny, and it is not too long, so it is a good story to start with.\n\nAnswer: I've taught \"Only Yesterday\" and would recommend it as a good starting point. It is a collection of short stories, so you can pick and choose based on the level of your students.\n\nYou can also select stories from his other collections, such as \"A Simple Story\" or \"A Guest for the Night\".\n\nIt's been a while since I've taught this material, so I can't say for certain what would be most appropriate.", "\\section{Curriculum}\n\nThe works of S. Y. Agnon are the perfect fit for a high school curriculum.

Is it a public school or a private school? Is it full of kids who are like her? Or is it full of kids who are a lot different then her?\n\nI know that it is hard to move schools and you don't want to move her to a different school. But if the school is a bad fit for her and she is not making friends, then maybe a different school would be better.\n\nYou also need to be careful about her making friends. Kids can be cruel and she can get made fun of for being smarter then all of the other kids. You don't want her to get bullied.\n\nI suggest that you talk to your daughter about who she wants to be friends with. If she wants to be friends with kids who are smarter then her, then I would say to go for it. But if you are worried about her being bullied, then maybe you can try to set up play dates at your house with kids that are smarter then her.

Whenever she said yes, I would tell her to send some invitations with her friends' names and phone numbers. I would also ask her to make a list of things that she wanted to do during the play date. She would then call her friends and invite them for a play date.\n\\item I tried to befriend her friends. I would talk to them and get to know them better. I would also invite them over for play dates. This way, my daughter would not feel like she was the only one who was trying to make friends.\n\\item I tried to be patient. I knew that it would take time for my daughter to make friends. I also knew that it would take time for her friends to get to know her better. I tried to be patient and not get frustrated.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: I think that this is a really great question. I think that it is important for parents to be aware of their child's needs and to be able to provide for them.\n\nI would suggest that you start by talking to your daughter about what she is interested in and what she enjoys doing. Then, you can try to find activities that she might enjoy and that might help her to make friends.\n\nFor example, if she enjoys art, you could try to find an art class for her to take. If she enjoys playing sports, you could try to find a sports team for her to join. If she enjoys reading, you could try to find a book club for her to join.\n\nI think that it is also important for parents to be aware of their daughter's feelings and to be able to provide support for them. If your daughter is feeling lonely or left out, you can try to help her to feel better by spending time with her and by helping her to find activities that she enjoys.\n\nI think that it is also important for parents to be aware of their daughter's social skills and to be able to teach them how to make friends. You can try to teach your daughter how to start and maintain conversations, how to be a good listener, and how to be a good friend.\n\nFinally, I think that it is important for parents to be aware of their own behavior and to be able to model good behavior for their children.

This is a difficult situation for her, as she is very extroverted and wants to make friends.  I don't know if I can offer much constructive advice, but here are some things that we have done:\n\n1) Try to find other children who are in her class that are interested in the same things.  In our school, there are other children that are very interested in math, so they have formed a Math Club.  My daughter is not in the Math Club, but she is one of the leaders of it.  She is also one of the leaders of the Nature Club.\n\n2) Try to find other children her age who are interested in similar things to her.  My daughter loves to read, and we have found some other kids in her class that love to read also.  They have formed a Reading Club.  My daughter is the leader of the Reading Club.\n\n3) Try to find other children her age that are interested in things \\em{unrelated} to her, but that she has common ground with.  My daughter is very good with computers, so she has found some other kids that have common ground with her in that area.\n\n4) Try to encourage her to find some kids that are \\em{not} in her class that are interested in the same things.  We have found some kids at her age that are at the local high school that are interested in similar things, and she has formed a relationship with them.

Find things that she likes to do, and get her involved in them.  Find things that she's good at, and get her involved in those.  She may be bored in school, but she may also be bored in some other activities.  If she's a good reader, then she may enjoy book clubs.  If she's a good artist, then she may enjoy art classes.  If she's a good athlete, then she may enjoy sports programs.  If she's good at science, then she may enjoy science clubs.\n\nI don't know enough about your daughter to make specific suggestions, but I'm sure you know enough about her to figure out where she might enjoy spending time with other people.  If you don't know that, then you probably need to spend more time with her.\n\nComment: \"Find things that she likes to do, and get her involved in them.\"  This is the key.  The best way to make friends is to find stuff you like to do and do it.  A lot of people are bored in school, but not for lack of things to do.  If she's not finding stuff she likes to do, she needs help with that.\n\nComment: @DaveG:  Absolutely.  Sometimes, the best thing you can do is to just find people who share your interests and help them organize.  You'll make friends, and you'll have a good time.\n\nComment: It's important to note that making friends is not just about finding common interests. It's about finding people who will be tolerant, understanding and supportive of your quirks, and not just people with similar quirks.  I don't think a mother can find a friend for her daughter; she has to let the girl make her own choices.\n\nComment: @Peter:  You're right, of course.  I was trying to write something that would get across the idea that there are things she can do to help, and I didn't want to get too specific in case there was some kind of personal issue that precluded certain activities.

{"prompt": "What are the main differences between Python and JavaScript programming languages?", "response_list": ["\\strong{In summary}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item JavaScript is a dynamic language, Python is a static language\n\\item JavaScript is interpreted, Python is compiled and executed on the fly (using an interpreter)\n\\item JavaScript is a prototype-based language, Python is an object-oriented language\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{In detail}\n\n\\strong{Performance}\n\nPython runs slower than JavaScript because of the dynamic typing, however, both are fast enough for most tasks.\n\n\\strong{Syntax}\n\nPython is more verbose than JavaScript. On the other hand, it's easier to read and understand.\n\n\\strong{Object-Oriented}\n\nPython is an object-oriented language. This means that everything is an object.\n\nJavaScript is a prototype-based language. That means that everything is a function and objects are built using prototype functions.\n\n\\strong{Functions}\n\nFunctions in JavaScript are first-class citizens. Everything is a function, and it's possible to pass functions as arguments, return them as return values, and store them in variables and data structures.\n\nThere is no such thing as function-oriented programming in Python. Functions are not first-class citizens. They are just a way to define reusable pieces of code.\n\n\\strong{Calling functions}\n\nIn JavaScript, it's necessary to use a function to call a function.\n\n\\begin{code}\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(\"foo\");\n}\n\nfoo();\n\\end{code}\n\nIn Python, it's possible to call a function directly.\n\n\\begin{code}\ndef foo():\n  print(\"foo\")\n\nfoo()\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{Types}\n\nJavaScript is a dynamic language. It doesn't care about the type of the variables and always coerces them to a common type.\n\nPython is a static language. It's possible to type-check code and prevent the runtime from doing unsafe operations.\n\nPython has two types:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item `object`: the base class of all objects\n\\item `None`: value that indicates the absence of a value\n\\end{itemize}\n\nJavaScript has no types. It has numbers, strings, boolean values, functions, and `undefined`.\n\n\\strong{Class}\n\nA class in JavaScript defines the prototype of an object.\n\nA class in Python defines the structure of an object.\n\n\\begin{code}\nclass Person:\n  def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):\n    self.first_name = first_name\n    self.last_name = last_name\n\nperson = Person(\"John\", \"Doe\")\n\nprint(person.first_name)\n\\end{code}\n\n\\strong{This vs. that}\n\nJavaScript has no `this` keyword. `this` refers to the object on which the method is called. It's a dynamic keyword that is not bound to a specific value until the call is resolved.\n\nPython has a `this` keyword. It refers to the object that owns the method.\n\n\\strong{Import}\n\nIn JavaScript, it's necessary to import modules using a module import system.\n\nIn Python, it's possible to import modules using a module import system or the built-in `import` statement.\n\nComment: thank you for your answer, I am looking for a more detailed explanation.\n\nComment: I'll add a few more details\n\nComment: thank you, I am waiting for the additional details.\n\nComment: I added more details\n\nComment: thank you for your explanation.\n\nAnswer: The biggest difference between python and js is that js has more focus on the front-end than python.\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest difference is the syntax. For example,\n\n\\begin{code}\n// js\nconst foo = 'bar';\n\nconst bar = () => {\n    return foo;\n};\n\nbar();\n\\end{code}\n\nIn Python, we can do this:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfoo = 'bar'\n\nbar = lambda: foo\n\nprint(bar())\n\\end{code}\n\nIn js, you have to assign a function to the variable to call it. In Python, you don't need to do this.\n\nComment: thank you for your answer, I am looking for a more detailed explanation.\n\nComment: I would suggest that you look at", "There are many different differences, but here are a few of the most important ones:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Python is a general-purpose programming language, while JavaScript is a scripting language.\n\\item Python is very popular for web development, while JavaScript is not as popular for that purpose.\n\\item Python is compiled, while JavaScript is interpreted.\n\\item Python has a more extensive standard library than JavaScript.\n\\item Python has more sophisticated data types than JavaScript.\n\\item Python is harder to learn than JavaScript.\n\\item JavaScript is faster than Python.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: There are many differences between Python and JavaScript. In terms of syntax, they are very different languages. Python is an interpreted language, while JavaScript is a scripting language. Python is also a general-purpose language, while JavaScript is mainly used for client-side scripting.\n\nIn terms of features, Python is much more powerful than JavaScript. Python has a built-in memory management system, while JavaScript does not. Python also has a comprehensive standard library, while JavaScript does not. Python also supports object-oriented programming, while JavaScript does not.\n\nIn terms of performance, Python is slower than JavaScript. Python is also more memory-intensive than JavaScript.\n\nIn terms of popularity, Python is much more popular than JavaScript. Python is used by many major companies, while JavaScript is mainly used for web development.\n\nIn terms of licensing, Python is free software, while JavaScript is not.\n\nIn summary, Python and JavaScript are very different languages with different strengths and weaknesses. Python is more powerful and has a more comprehensive standard library, but it is also slower and more memory-intensive. JavaScript is faster and more lightweight, but it is also less powerful and has a smaller standard library.\n\nAnswer: A lot of differences\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Python is an interpreted language while JavaScript is a scripting language.\n\\item Python is a general-purpose language while JavaScript is a client-side scripting language.\n\\item Python is compiled while JavaScript is interpreted.\n\\item Python has a more extensive standard library than JavaScript.\n\\item Python has more sophisticated data types than JavaScript.\n\\item Python is harder to learn than JavaScript.\n\\item JavaScript is faster than Python.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: The biggest difference between Python and JavaScript is that Python is a programming language while JavaScript is a scripting language. This means that Python is more powerful and can be used for a wider range of tasks than JavaScript.\n\nAnother big difference is that Python is an interpreted language while JavaScript is a compiled language. This means that Python code is executed line by line at runtime while JavaScript code is converted into machine code before execution. This makes Python code slower to execute than JavaScript code but also makes it easier to debug because you can see the actual code being executed.\n\nFinally, Python has a much larger standard library than JavaScript. This means that Python has a lot of built-in functionality that you can use without having to write your own code. For example, the `os` module in Python provides functions for working with files and directories while the `fs` module in JavaScript provides only a few basic functions.\n\nAnswer: Python is a programming language with a rich standard library.

{"prompt": "What are the differences between plant-based and animal-based protein sources?", "response_list": ["\\section{The short answer: all protein sources are different.}\n\nThe \"differences\" between plant and animal protein sources are \\strong{many}.\n\nProbably the most important of these is the variety of amino acids present. All proteins are made of combinations of amino acids, and these combinations are \\strong{not always equal}.\n\nThere are 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins.\n\nThere are 9 essential amino acids that must be obtained from the diet.\n\nThere are also 11 non-essential amino acids that can be synthesized by the body.\n\nThe composition of these amino acids in different proteins differs. For example, animal proteins are richer in [BCAA's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branched-chain_amino_acids) (branched-chain amino acids), which are the building blocks for muscle, than plant proteins.\n\nThe second most important difference is the amount of protein per serving. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nFor example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nThe third most important difference is how complete or incomplete a protein source is. A protein is considered to be complete if it contains all 9 essential amino acids.\n\nFor example, animal proteins are complete proteins, whereas plant proteins are considered incomplete proteins. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nAn \"incomplete\" protein source is one that does not contain all of the essential amino acids. For example, soybeans are an incomplete protein source because they do not contain the essential amino acid tryptophan.\n\nAnimal proteins are complete proteins, whereas plant proteins are considered incomplete proteins. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nThe fourth most important difference is the digestibility of the protein source. Animal proteins are more digestible than plant proteins, meaning that they are easier for the body to absorb.\n\nFor example, animal proteins are more digestible than plant proteins, meaning that they are easier for the body to absorb. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nAnimal proteins are more digestible than plant proteins, meaning that they are easier for the body to absorb. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nLastly, plant proteins are typically more energy-dense than animal proteins. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nLastly, plant proteins are typically more energy-dense than animal proteins. For example, a 3 oz serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, whereas a 3 oz serving of red meat contains about 21 grams of protein.\n\nIf you are trying to build muscle, it is important to get enough protein in your diet. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that you get about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n\nIf you are trying to build muscle, it is important to get enough protein in your diet. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that you get about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n\nFor example, a 180 pound person would need to consume about 63 grams of protein per day.\n\nIf you are trying to build muscle, it is important to get enough protein in your diet.", "\\strong{Protein} is an important nutrient in our diet. It is used by the body to build and repair tissue by providing the amino acids needed to make new proteins.\n\n\\strong{Animals} can produce their own amino acids from different types of foods. But, this is not the case for \\strong{plants}. Plants cannot make the amino acids that the body needs, so they have to get them from the soil, water, and air.\n\n\\strong{Animal-based} proteins include meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products. These are all good sources of protein because they contain all of the essential amino acids that your body needs.\n\n\\strong{Plant-based} proteins include beans, nuts, seeds, and grains. These foods contain some or all of the essential amino acids, but not all of them.

This answer is not a good answer because, for example, it does not explain how the proteins are different.", "The differences are huge and many. Here are a few:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Nutritional content: animal-based proteins contain a lot of saturated fats, cholesterol and vitamin B12 while plant-based proteins contain much less of those and more of the good stuff (fiber, antioxidants, etc.)\n\\item Environmental sustainability: animal-based proteins are much more expensive to produce (a lot of land, water and feed has to go into it) and generate a lot of harmful emissions.\n\\item Health: animal-based proteins are linked to many health issues (heart disease, obesity, etc.) while plant-based proteins are linked to many health benefits (lower blood pressure, lower risk of heart disease, lower risk of diabetes, etc.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: What about the nutritional content of animal-based proteins?\n\nAnswer: I would say that there is a lot of confusion in this. The first thing to note is that there are many types of protein. Proteins can be classified into two types, animal and plant. Animal proteins are from meat, eggs and dairy products. Plant proteins are from vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes and nuts. There are many dietary sources of protein.\n\n[Different types of protein](https://i.stack.imgur.com/t4N6y.jpg)\n\nProtein is important for the body as it is a building block of cells and helps with the immune system, growth and repair of tissues. It also helps with the production of hormones and enzymes. Protein is needed for the production of amino acids that are used in the body for cellular metabolism.\n\nThere are different types of protein and each has its own unique benefits. Some of the most important types of protein are animal protein, plant protein, whey protein and casein protein.\n\nIf you are looking for a good source of protein, you should look at the different types of protein and see which one would be best for you. There are many different types of protein and each has its own unique benefits. It is important to choose the right type of protein for your needs.\n\nThere are many different types of protein, but the two main types are animal protein and plant protein. Animal protein is found in meat, milk, eggs, fish, and other animal products. Plant protein is found in grains, legumes, nuts, and vegetables.\n\n[Animal and Plant Protein](https://i.stack.imgur.com/91PpU.jpg)\n\nAnimal protein is made up of amino acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids that can be combined to make protein. Each type of animal protein has its own unique amino acid profile.\n\nPlant protein is also made up of amino acids, but there are fewer amino acids in plant proteins than there are in animal proteins. Plant proteins also have a lower biological value than animal proteins. This means that plant proteins are not as effective at building muscle as animal proteins.\n\n[Animal vs Plant protein](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Ky9J.jpg)\n\nAnimal proteins are generally considered to be better for building muscle than plant proteins. This is because animal proteins have a higher biological value than plant proteins. Biological value is a measure of how well a protein is digested and absorbed by the body. Animal proteins are also generally considered to be more complete than plant proteins. Complete proteins contain all of the essential amino acids that the body needs.\n\nPlant proteins are generally considered to be better for overall health than animal proteins. This is because plant proteins are generally lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than animal proteins. Plant proteins are also generally considered to be more environmentally friendly than animal proteins.\n\nIf you are looking for a protein source that is good for both muscle growth and overall health, then you should consider using a mix of both plant and animal proteins. There are many different types of protein powders available, so you can find one that fits your needs.\n\n[Protein powder](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uaq5k.jpg)\n\nIf you are looking for a protein supplement, then you should look for one that contains both animal and plant", "The main difference between plant-based and animal-based protein is that the first one needs more proteins and the second one needs less proteins.\n\nPlant-based protein sources are high in fibre and low in fat. They are also rich in vitamins and minerals.\n\nOn the other hand, animal-based protein sources are high in fat and low in fibre. They are also rich in vitamins and minerals.\n\nComment: Do you have any references to back up your statement?\n\nAnswer: There are several differences between plant-based and animal-based protein.\n\nPlant protein is generally lower in calories and fat than animal protein, but it also contains more fiber. Plant protein is also higher in antioxidants and phytochemicals, which can help protect against disease.\n\nAnimal protein is generally higher in calories and fat than plant protein, but it also contains more amino acids, which are essential for muscle growth and repair. Animal protein is also higher in saturated fat, which can increase cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease.\n\nAnswer: The main difference between plant-based and animal-based protein is that plant-based protein is typically lower in calories and fat, while animal-based protein is typically higher in calories and fat. Additionally, plant-based protein typically contains more fiber and antioxidants, while animal-based protein typically contains more saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nComment: Do you have any references to back up your statement?", "\\begin{blockquote}\nIs plant-based protein more or less efficient than animal protein?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAs far as I know, the answer is \\strong{No}. Both types of protein are equally efficient.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nDoes plant-based protein have more or less amino acids?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe answer is \\strong{No}.

Individual school districts have a lot of leeway in deciding what to teach, how to teach it, and who to teach.

They still have some control, but it's not nearly as big of a role as you might think.\n\nComment: The federal government makes sure that kids are taught US History and how to be good citizens.

The assessment system must be aligned with the state's challenging academic content standards and must measure student achievement against those standards.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n(from http://www.ncsd.org.au/documents/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act.pdf)\n\nThe problem is that the tests are designed so that 70% of students will fail (and this is a conservative estimate). This is done by design, not by accident. The tests are set to very high standards and the students will never meet those standards which is why the tests are designed this way.\n\nThe reason the tests are designed this way is so that the government can say that the schools are failing and that the government needs to step in and do something. It also allows the government to say that the schools are failing even though all of the tests are designed to be impossible to pass.\n\nSo really, the government is the one who is failing the schools, not the other way around.\n\nThe school districts that are doing well are the ones that take the time to develop strategies to help their students pass the tests, even though the tests are designed to be impossible to pass.\n\nThe other strategy is to just keep the test scores low so that the schools aren't considered failing.\n\nThe reason there are \"good\" and \"bad\" school districts is because the government likes to say that schools are failing, despite the fact that the tests are designed to be impossible to pass.\n\nComment: Thank you very much for the answer.

Yes, you are correct. I have fixed the typo. Thank you.\n\nAnswer: It's a complicated question.  In my experience, funding is a huge factor.  Bad school districts receive less funding than good school districts, but they're still expected to turn out students with a certain level of proficiency.  They're also not allowed to use the funding to hire better teachers.  They're just supposed to make do with what they have.  Bad school districts also have a lot of students who come from impoverished homes, which is an obstacle.  All of the reasons you've listed in your question are probably factors, as well.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. I think you have a typo.

The government does not work hard enough to increase education standards because the government does not work hard enough at all.\n\nThe government is full of people who do not want to work hard, who do not want to work at all.\n\nAnswer: I think that the question is too vague. Every state in the US funds its public school districts differently. Some rely heavily on property taxes, some rely heavily on sales taxes, some use a mixture of both, and some use a different tax altogether.\n\nIn Illinois, where I live, the funding of public schools is a hot political issue. Some school districts are rich and some are poor. Some districts spend millions of dollars per student and some have less than $25,000 per student.\n\nThe state government provides a minimum funding level for every district, but that is not enough to provide a good education for every child in Illinois. There are three major issues that contribute to these large differences in funding:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item State funding formulas are based on the taxable wealth of each district. The state provides the minimum amount and the local school boards can raise additional monies through local property taxes. The poorer districts do not have the tax base to raise significant funds.\n\\item The state government is constantly borrowing money to pay the bills. If a district wants to build a new school or a new wing to an existing school, it needs to get a loan from a bank or other private lender. The rate of interest on these loans is increasing as lenders are getting nervous about the state of Illinois' finances.\n\\item The state government does not have a \"level playing field\" in its funding formulas. This is a big issue in Illinois right now. Some districts are paying their teachers less than $20,000 per year. Other districts are paying teachers more than $100,000 per year. Some districts have huge numbers of students that are receiving free and reduced lunches. Other districts have very few.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI believe that these are the primary reasons why there are \"bad school districts\" and \"good school districts\" in the U.S.\n\nComment: I think you've explained it pretty well. I would just add that most of the districts in bad shape *want* more money, but they have no leverage to get it.\n\nComment: @David, I think that you have a very good point. There are a lot of school districts that are in bad shape, but they are having a hard time getting more money.\n\nAnswer: Well, it's not that hard to explain.\n\nThe Federal government doesn't fund schools.\n\nThe states do.  Each state does it differently.  Some have a large federal presence, some have a very small one.\n\nSo, there's a lot of variation.\n\nI think that's the answer you're looking for.\n\nAnswer: The US government is not a single unified entity; it is a collection of many different entities, including many states.  The states and their school districts are generally funded by local property taxes, and the tax base and ability to raise taxes varies greatly across the", "The short version is that the US government doesn't really work hard to increase education standards.\n\nThe long version is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, many school districts are \\em{very} large, and as such they are more like a collection of smaller school districts with a centralized bureaucracy. As a result, the centralized bureaucracy has a lot of money and power, so it has a lot of influence on the local schools.\n\nSecond, this money and power can be used to influence how the schools are run, and what standards they're held to.\n\nThird, even if the government doesn't want the centralized bureaucracy to do this, it has a hard time stopping them.\n\nFinally, the government can't really do anything to stop the centralized bureaucracy if it doesn't want to.\n\nAnswer: The short answer is that the government doesn't have that much control over education.\n\nIn the United States, primary and secondary education is handled at the state and local level. The federal government makes some money available for K-12 education, but it's a relatively small percentage of total spending.\n\nThe federal government does have a lot of control over colleges and universities, but that's not what you're asking about.\n\nComment: The federal government also has a lot of control over primary and secondary education, through its control of the states' budgets.\n\nAnswer: Yes, because the government is the education system.", "The schools are divided into districts, and the funding that each district gets is determined by the state government.\n\nThe funding is often quite uneven. Some states have a [Court Ordered Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_ordered_plan#United_States) that requires the state to fund all districts at the same level, but many states have not established such a plan.\n\nThere are also [school choice programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_choice) in some states, which allow students to attend schools outside of their district, but only if there is funding for them.\n\nComment: Thank you so much!

But, if the guest is really set on having something specific, it's appropriate for them to speak up, and it's always best to give them the option to do so.\n\nAnswer: If you're inviting a group of people to your house, you can ask any one of them for a list of foods they DO eat and don't eat.  You could do this individually by phone, or you could send out a group email asking who has any special dietary needs.  You could also call in advance to a restaurant to ask about dietary needs.\n\nBut really, it's on the guest to tell you.  If you want to know for sure, you can ask \"Anyone need a gluten free meal?\" or something similar.\n\nAnswer: It is always best to ask, but if a guest is gluten-free, they will likely volunteer it.

In fact, I was quite surprised that the waiter didn't ask me what I was ordering when we made the reservation.  On the other hand, I have only been to one restaurant, and it was a Michelin-starred one, so that experience might not be representative.\n\nAnswer: You should certainly let the restaurant know if you have a serious food allergy, and they should be able to accommodate it to some extent.  For example, if you can't eat anything with nuts, they should be able to make substitutions in a dish with a nut sauce.  They might also be able to provide a dish that doesn't have the nut sauce.\n\nI've had similar situations with fish allergies.  I've been able to get a substitute dish with a fish-free sauce.  I've also been able to get fish removed from a dish.  It's always a good idea to let the restaurant know in advance, though, so that they can make substitutions for you.\n\nIf you have a less serious food allergy or if you just don't like certain kinds of food, you'll have to be more flexible about what you get.  You might not be able to get a dish without the ingredient you don't like, but you might be able to ask them to leave it out.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the food, you should definitely ask the waiter.  You can also ask to speak to the chef.\n\nComment: As for the fish allergy, it was a situation where the waiter said the chef will not make a substitution.\n\nComment: @Mark: If that's the case, you might have to just skip that restaurant.\n\nComment: @Mark: You should definitely ask the waiter to speak to the chef.

The answer given above would be applicable to: 1) something that was illegal 100 years ago that is now legal. 2) something that was legal 100 years ago that is now illegal. 3) something that was not legal or illegal 100 years ago but is now legal. 4) something that was not legal or illegal 100 years ago but is now illegal. 5) something that was not legal or illegal 100 years ago but is now legal and illegal. 6) something that was legal 100 years ago that is now legal but is not acceptable today.\n\nComment: @Jason: I have edited to clarify the question.  Thanks for pointing it out.\n\nComment: @Jason: I think this is a good answer.  Smoking is something that was acceptable 100 years ago that is unacceptable today.\n\nComment: @Steven: I disagree.  Smoking is something that is acceptable today that was unacceptable 100 years ago.  It is a good answer, just the OP probably didn't mean that.  I think we can agree that smoking is unacceptable today, right?\n\nComment: @Jason: Are you sure you don't want to edit the question to make it more specific?  It seems like you are just guessing.\n\nComment: @Steven: I'm confused.  Are you saying smoking is acceptable today?  It seems to me that smoking is a good example, and I think we can agree on that.\n\nComment: @Jason: I am saying that smoking is unacceptable today.  That was my entire point about it.\n\nComment: @Steven: You could have just said that.  I was just trying to clarify the question.\n\nComment: @Jason: I think you should edit the question if you want to clarify it.\n\nComment: @Steven: I agree with Jason.  I think its good enough.  Just because you think you know what the OP means doesn't mean you can change the question.\n\nComment: @Rob: In most cases I would agree with you.  In this case, I think the answer was posted before the question was edited.  I'm not saying I am correct, just that I disagree with you.\n\nComment: @Steven: I disagree.  I think Rob is right.  I was just trying to help clarify the question.  I guess I could have been more direct.\n\nComment: @Jason: I think you are right.  It is not my question, and I'm not the OP, and I am not the person who edited the question.  I was just trying to clarify it.  I am sorry if I was rude at all.\n\nComment: @Jason: I'm sorry, but I think you were right.  Smoking is only unacceptable today in a few places, which is not really what I was looking for.  I edited the question to reflect this.\n\nComment: @Steven: I think you were right.  I am sorry for being rude.  I think both of your answers are excellent and I have upvoted both of you.\n\nComment: @Jason: I think this is a good answer.\n\nAnswer: It would be interesting to see if there were any examples of something that was legal 100 years ago that is now illegal.  I honestly can't think of anything.\n\nEDIT:\n\nOne is gay marriage.  I think it was illegal, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nComment: @Jason: I", "\\section{The word \\em{gay}}\n\nThe word \\em{gay} has changed meaning over the centuries. The original meaning, which began in the late 13th century, was \"cheerful, merry, happy\".\n\nIn the 15th century, it also began to mean \"eccentric, odd\". This is probably where we get the modern connotation of \"homosexual\", as that was considered eccentric in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThere are some who argue that the connotation of \"homosexual\" was already present in the late 19th century. For example, the song \"The Gay Divorcee\" was released in 1933, and it is hard to imagine why it would refer to a heterosexual couple.\n\nComment: This is a good answer, but \"cheerful, merry, happy\" is a meaning of *gay* in the 21st century as well.\n\nComment: @JonathanLeffler - Absolutely, though I'm not sure whether it's still in common usage.\n\nComment: It is.  But we tend to use *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\" and *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\".  (I'm a Brit, and I don't know if this is true elsewhere.)\n\nComment: @JonathanLeffler - Ah, I had no idea. It's a very different nuance.\n\nComment: @JonathanLeffler - I am a Brit and I use *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".\n\nComment: @WS2 - I tend to use *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\" and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\" (and when I am really, really happy, I may say *ecstatic*).\n\nComment: @JonathanLeffler - So you use \"cheerful\" for the kind of happiness that would be used to describe a minority of people and \"gay\" for the kind of happiness that would be used to describe a majority of people?\n\nComment: @WS2 - I tend to use *cheerful* for \"happy in a low-key way\", and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".  *Cheerful* works equally well for a minority or majority of people.\n\nComment: @JonathanLeffler - Ok, so I have the wrong connotation for \"cheerful\" then.\n\nComment: @WS2 - It is the connotation that you would get from the adjectival form of *cheer*.  If cheerfulness is a minority experience, you might consider that the word has been coopted.  I'm not aware of any significant change in the meaning of *cheerful* over the centuries, or even the last few decades.\n\nComment: @WS2 - *Cheerful* is the kind of happiness that you feel when people are being cheerful, and *gay* for the kind of happiness that you feel when people are being gay.\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm American and I use \"gay\" for \"wonderfully happy\".\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm a Brit, and I use *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\" and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".  I think that's fairly common.\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm an American and I use *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\" and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".  I think that's fairly common, too.\n\nComment: @WS2 - I also use \"cheerful\" for \"pleasantly happy\" and \"gay\" for \"wonderfully happy\", but I'm from Scotland.\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm American and I use *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\" and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm an American, and I use \"cheerful\" for \"pleasantly happy\" and \"gay\" for \"wonderfully happy\".\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm an American, and I use *cheerful* for \"pleasantly happy\" and *gay* for \"wonderfully happy\".\n\nComment: @WS2 - I'm an American, and I", "Many things have changed in this time.\n\n[Female suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_suffrage) was not obtained until 1928 in the UK, and 1918 in the USA.\n\n[Roman Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) and Protestantism were very much opposed to each other.

The bartender would roll his eyes and say, \"I can't believe I'm serving you again, Captain!\"\n\nComment: @Jay - That's not true.

{"prompt": "What are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?", "response_list": ["This answer is based on my own research and experience. The key thing to focus on is the amount of water you are using.\n\nSome people believe that using a reusable bottle and filling it from the tap at home saves water, while others believe it is better to use disposable bottled water. The truth is, it depends on how you use it.\n\nIf your home water filter is dirty, drinking from the tap could expose you to bacteria and other harmful substances. If this is the case, it is best to use bottled water.\n\nIf you are using a reusable bottle and filling it with tap water, make sure you are using a filter before drinking.\n\nIf you are using a reusable bottle and filling it with water from a fountain, make sure the fountain is clean.\n\nIf you are using a reusable bottle and filling it with water from a natural source, such as a river or lake, make sure the water is clean and safe to drink.\n\nThe bottom line is that it is best to use a reusable bottle, but only if you are sure the water you are drinking is safe.\n\nComment: You are right. The amount of water used is a key issue. I guess the problem with this question is that what you say is not really quantifiable. And it is also difficult to compare.\n\nComment: I completely agree. The best thing to do is to use a reusable bottle. But if you are not sure about the quality of the water, it is better to use bottled water.\n\nAnswer: There are a lot of people who believe that the use of plastic water bottles has a negative impact on the environment. These people believe that the production of plastic water bottles requires a lot of energy and resources, and the disposal of these bottles creates a lot of waste.\n\nThere are a number of organizations that are working to reduce the use of plastic water bottles, and there are a number of alternatives to plastic water bottles that are available.\n\nSome of the alternatives to plastic water bottles include metal water bottles, glass water bottles, and reusable water bottles.\n\nAnswer: There are a lot of people who believe that using a reusable water bottle is better for the environment than using a plastic water bottle. Some people say that the production of plastic water bottles requires a lot of energy and resources, and the disposal of these bottles creates a lot of waste. On the other hand, reusable water bottles can be used over and over again, so they help reduce the amount of waste that is produced.\n\nAnswer: Using a reusable water bottle is better for the environment than using a disposable plastic water bottle. The reason for this is that plastic water bottles are made from petroleum, which is a non-renewable resource. When you use a disposable plastic water bottle, you are using up a non-renewable resource. This means that the earth will eventually run out of petroleum.\n\nReusable water bottles, on the other hand, are made from materials that are renewable. This means that they can be used over and over again, without depleting the earth's resources. In addition, reusable water bottles are usually made from recycled materials, which helps to reduce the amount of waste that is produced.\n\nAnswer: There are a lot of people who believe that using a reusable water bottle is better for the environment than using a disposable water bottle. Some people say that using a reusable water bottle is better for the environment because you are not creating more waste, and you are not using more resources.\n\nAnswer: There are a lot of people who believe that using a reusable bottle is better for the environment than using a disposable bottle. There are a number of reasons for this.\n\nFirst of all, when you use a reusable bottle, you are not creating any waste. This is because the bottle can be used over and over again. This means that there is no need to throw away the bottle after each use. This is a good thing for the environment because it means that there is less waste being created.\n\nSecond of all, when you use a reusable bottle, you are not using up any resources. This is because the bottle can be used over and over again. This means that there is no need to create any new bottles. This is a good thing for the environment because it means that there is less demand for resources.\n\nOverall, using a reusable bottle is better for the environment", "The following is a table I have compiled in a previous class which includes references to the research papers that I have cited. Included is the amount of energy required to produce each single-use plastic bottle and a reusable stainless steel bottle, the amount of water required to produce the bottles, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the amount of plastic water bottles produced globally in 2006, and the amount of reusable steel bottles produced globally in 2006. The only thing I have not included is the amount of water required to produce a reusable plastic bottle, but the paper itself does not give the exact number.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4yKWg.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nComment: Note: the \"reusable stainless steel bottle\" is a one-off, whereas the single-use plastic bottle is for one use only. The reusable bottle will be used many times, so the energy consumption is much lower.\n\nAnswer: The following is an answer to your question:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nWhat are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nPlastic bottles are made from oil and are considered as a non-renewable source of energy. According to a 2015 study, it is estimated that the production of a single-use plastic bottle requires 17 million barrels of oil. This amount of oil is enough to fuel 1.3 million cars for an entire year.\n\nOn the other hand, the production of a reusable bottle requires a lot less energy than that of a single-use bottle. In the same study, it is estimated that the production of a reusable bottle requires 32 gallons of water, 20% less energy, and 90% less of CO2 emission.\n\nThe reusable bottle is also more eco-friendly than the single-use bottle. In a 2018 study, it was estimated that 60 billion plastic water bottles are produced every year and it takes 450 years for a plastic bottle to degrade. In contrast, a reusable bottle can be reused for many years and it is made from stainless steel which is 100% recyclable.\n\nOverall, reusable bottles are more eco-friendly and sustainable than single-use plastic bottles. They require less energy and resources to produce, and they are recyclable. Therefore, it is important to switch to reusable bottles to reduce the amount of waste and pollution in the environment.\n\n[References](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/plastic-bottles-environment-pollution-health/)", "According to the National Geographic [article](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/news/2011/11/111102-bottled-water-environment-health-impact-science-dehydration/)\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\"If you drink a liter of bottled water, it requires 1.5 liters of water to produce it,\" says Peter Gleick, an expert on water policies at the Pacific Institute in Oakland, California. \"This water is used in the production of the plastic bottle, the energy to drive the production machinery and transportation, and so on.\"\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere is also a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6387994/) conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which states:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nBottled water requires significantly more energy to produce than tap water, and the production of the plastic bottles generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere is a [study](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/ee/c4ee00085j) conducted by the Royal Society of Chemistry, which states:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe environmental impact of bottled water is significant and includes pollution issues, increased fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nFor a reusable bottle, you may have to wash it before reuse.

They are made from petroleum. The process of making plastic from petroleum requires petroleum refining. The process of petroleum refining is a long one. It starts with the process of drilling and ends with a plastic bottle.\n\nDrilling: Once a location is chosen, an exploratory well is drilled from the surface to depths of about 1,000 feet.\n\nTransporting: The oil is then pumped to the surface, where it is stored temporarily in a \"stock tank.\" From there, it is pumped to a storage tank for processing.\n\nSeparation: In the separation stage, the crude oil is heated and placed in distillation towers.\n\nRefining: The oil is heated and distilled again in a crude oil furnace.\n\nThe products are then separated, such as:\n\nGasoline\n\nJet Fuel\n\nDiesel\n\nResidual fuel oil\n\nChemicals\n\nWaxes\n\nOil is a finite resource and the process of drilling, transporting, and refining all produce a lot of greenhouse gases.\n\n\\strong{Reusable plastic bottle}\n\nAs for reusable plastic bottles, they are made from the same thing but they aren't being produced in such large quantities and are being recycled.\n\n\\strong{Single-use plastic bottle}\n\nAs for the single-use plastic bottle, it is a waste of energy and resources.\n\n\\strong{Reusable plastic bottle}\n\nAs for a reusable plastic bottle, it is a step in the right direction. It is a more sustainable option.\n\nAnswer: Your topic statement is not clear.  Are you saying the reusable plastic bottles are better for the environment and human health than single-use bottles?  I'm not sure what you are asking.  If you mean the single-use plastic bottle has the potential to pollute the environment and harm human health...yes.\n\nThe single-use plastic bottles are not recycled, so they have the potential to pollute the environment.  They are also harmful to human health when ingested.\n\nThe reusable plastic bottles are recycled.  Therefore, they do not have the potential to pollute the environment.  They are also not harmful to human health when ingested.\n\nHowever, reusable plastic bottles are not always the best option.  There are many reusable plastic bottles that are made from polycarbonate.  This type of plastic contains dangerous chemicals, such as BPA.\n\nIf you are going to use a reusable plastic bottle, make sure it is BPA-free.\n\nComment: You've got the direction reversed.  For the most part, reusable plastic bottles are not recycled.  (https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/bottled-water-is-the-latest-environmental-issue-heres-how-to-avoid-plastic-waste/2019/07/02/3780ca7e-8c5e-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html)\n\nComment: @S.McGrew, I found this post that indicates that reusable plastic bottles are recycled, but I also found this post that indicates that reusable bottles are not the best option.  https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/ask-greenpeace-are-reusable-water-bottles-better-for-the-planet/\n\nComment: Reusable bottles aren't the best option, but they are better than single-use bottles.", "There are a few different things to consider.\n\n\\section{Environment}\n\nThe problem with a single-use plastic bottle is that it is...single-use.  Once you've used it, it becomes \\em{waste}, and the more waste we have, the larger the environmental impact.\n\nReusable bottles have an obvious advantage.  If you are going to get thirsty a few times a day, why buy a new bottle each time?  You can just refill the same bottle.  The biggest drawback with a reusable bottle is that you need to keep it clean.  This is usually not a difficult task, and it does not necessarily lead to increased environmental impact.  The biggest advantage of a reusable bottle is that you do not have to buy as many bottles.\n\n\\section{Human health}\n\nThere is a lot of controversy over BPA (bisphenol A).  BPA is used on the internal surface of a lot of plastic bottles, and has been shown to cause some health problems (or at least be correlated with some problems), but also not be correlated with health problems.\n\nIt seems like there is a lot of disagreement on this topic, and I don't think there is a clear answer.  The biggest thing to consider is how long you are keeping your bottle.  If you are only going to use the bottle once, that's probably not a huge deal.\n\nIf you are going to keep it for several days, you should probably make sure that it does not have BPA.  If you are going to keep it for several years, you should definitely make sure that it does not have BPA.  If that's the case, I would probably choose a glass bottle.\n\nComment: I'm not sure that I can agree there is a lot of controversy over BPA. The only controversy appears to be between those who are aware of the facts and those who are not.\n\nComment: There are some studies that show that there is no problem, and some studies that show there is a problem.  I am not aware of a study that shows that there is absolutely no problem, but there might be.\n\nComment: It's not a question of whether there's a problem or not. The problem is that those who claim that there isn't a problem are ignoring the evidence that there is one.\n\nComment: I just edited my answer.  I think the biggest issue is a lack of consistency in the scientific community.  There are a lot of people who claim that there is no problem, and a lot of people who claim that there is a problem.  There is no clear answer.\n\nComment: I suggest you stop talking about \"people who claim\" and look at the evidence instead. The jury is not out on this one. There is clear evidence of a problem and no evidence of a lack of a problem.\n\nComment: I think we can agree that there are two groups of people: those who have looked at the evidence and those who have not.  I think the people who have looked at the evidence are less likely to see a problem.\n\nComment: @user6972: I'd like to add that while reusable bottles require a bit more effort to clean and make sure they are clean, a clean reusable bottle is better for you than any number of single-use plastic bottles."]}

Animals with larger brains, such as humans, are able to talk.\n\nThe ability to create the sounds is also important. Animals with larger vocal cords, such as humans, are able to produce the sounds needed to talk.\n\nThe ability to understand the sounds is also important. Animals with larger brains, such as humans, are able to understand the sounds needed to talk.\n\nComment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not a question about Biology.\n\nComment: @MarkBannister I disagree. The question is about the science behind parrot speech, which is a biological phenomenon.", "The answer is very complex. It is a question of definition. Can a parrot talk? Can a parrot talk like a human? Can a parrot talk without being trained? Can a parrot talk without being exposed to human speech?\n\nPsittacines (parrots) have a very complex vocal apparatus. Their ability to vocalize is unparalleled in the animal kingdom. They have an additional organ, the syrinx, that allows them to produce two different notes at the same time. Humans only have one vocal organ and we don't have the ability to produce two notes at the same time (although we can sing a melody with two different notes at the same time, we achieve this by combining two different sounds; there is only one sound that comes out of our mouth at a time).\n\nParrots also have a very powerful brain. They have a very large cerebral cortex, the part that is important for processing sensory information and high cognitive functions. They also have an unusually large hippocampus, the part of the brain that is very important for learning and memory.\n\nParrots are very social animals and as such they are very communicative. They vocalize to each other, to their parents, to their young, to their partners, to other parrots, etc. They also communicate with humans. They do that by imitation, but also by using a large repertoire of sounds.\n\nMost parrot species do not vocalize in imitation of human speech. They have a limited repertoire of sounds, but they learn to use them in context. Some species have been known to use a limited repertoire of words or phrases, but they lack the fundamental grammatical skills that humans have (e.g. they cannot associate words with objects, nor can they combine two words to make a sentence).\n\nThe ability to vocalize like a human is mostly a matter of being exposed to human speech. Parrots that are raised in the wild do not learn to talk like humans. They learn to vocalize in the manner of their own species. They do not learn how to vocalize like a human just because they don't have any human speech to listen to. The same goes for feral parrots that are released in the wild. They do not vocalize like humans, they will vocalize like a parrot.\n\nIf a parrot is raised in captivity, it will learn to vocalize like a human, but it will only do so if it is exposed to human speech. This is why parrots that are kept in a cage without human contact don't talk, and why parrots that are kept with humans do.\n\nCan a parrot have its own thoughts and vocalize them? This is a very difficult question to answer. We don't know how the brain of a parrot works and we don't know if parrots do have thoughts. We do know that parrots have memory and that they can learn. We also know that they can remember what they have been taught. We also know that they can combine different sounds and can associate different sounds with different stimuli. This is the basis of what we call \"parrot-speech\".\n\nAre parrots conscious and do they have a sense of self? We don't know. We do know that they can recognize themselves in a mirror and that they can recognize other birds of their own species. We also know that they can recognize their owners.

This means that it is optimized for computing gradients and running backpropagation, making it faster and more efficient for training deep learning models.\n\\item JAX is designed to be integrated with other tools and libraries for deep learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. This makes it easy to use JAX with other tools and libraries, and allows for greater flexibility and customization in building deep learning models.\n\\item JAX is designed for scalability and parallelism. It is optimized for running computations on multiple CPUs and GPUs at the same time, making it faster for training large deep learning models.\n\\item JAX is designed with a modular architecture, which allows for easy extension and customization.

It can also be used for automatic differentiation, which PyTorch doesn't offer.\n\nComment: Not to mention that it is much more performant than PyTorch for neural networks.\n\nComment: \"faster than PyTorch\" is not a good statement. I can run TF, PyTorch and JAX all on a single machine with the same dataset and achieve the same results. JAX is faster at a given number of resources, and slower at a given accuracy.\n\nComment: @Faraz That's a good point. I'll update the answer to reflect that.", "The main reason to use JAX in place of PyTorch is to be able to use the `jax.jacfwd` function to get derivatives with respect to a single input (the \"feedforward\" computation), which is an important operation if you are trying to train a neural network using the ADAM optimizer.\n\nThe basic idea is that you have your computation `z = f(x)` and you want to find the derivative of `z` with respect to `x`. Using `jax.jacfwd` on `f` will find the derivative of `z` with respect to `x`, but it will also find a different function that will evaluate `z` efficiently, given any value of `x`. This can be used to compute the gradient of one step of ADAM.\n\nIn PyTorch, you can use the `torch.autograd` package to find the gradients of computed values, but this requires you to pass `f` a list of all of the inputs, including all of the intermediate values of the computation. That can be costly, since `f` will have to recompute all of the intermediate values, in order to find the gradient.\n\nComment: I'm trying to understand how JAX can find a function `g` that computes `f(x)` efficiently. `f` is a function that takes a single number and returns a vector. So, `g` is a function that takes a single number and returns a vector. But, if I take the derivative of `f`, I get a function that takes a vector and returns a matrix or a vector. How can `g`'s input be a number?\n\nComment: @user1998648 It's not that straightforward. `f(x)` is a computation that you've defined. You then call `jax.jacfwd` on it, which produces a new computation `g` that has the same input/output specifications as `f`. Then, you can call `jax.jacgrad(g, x)` to get the gradient of `g` with respect to `x`, and you'll get a function that can be used to compute the gradient of `f` with respect to `x`.\n\nComment: Why do you need a new function `g`? I would expect that the `autograd` in PyTorch would be able to produce a new function `g` that has the same input/output specifications as `f` in O(1) time.\n\nComment: @user1998648 I think you are misunderstanding a couple of things. First, `autograd` only works if you pass it a list of all of the inputs to `f`, which is usually not efficient. Second, `g` is not a new function. It's a new computation, which is a representation of the same function that `f` is a representation of.\n\nComment: The `jax.jacgrad` function requires you to pass in a function `g` that has the same input/output specifications as `f`. How does `jax.jacgrad` construct such a `g`?\n\nComment: @user1998648 It's not a function. It's a computation. It's a representation of a function, as described in the question and the linked article.\n\nComment: `jax.jacgrad` takes in a computation `g`. If we have a computation `g`, we can make it into a function with the same input/output specifications as `f` by running `g` with `x = np.ones(1)`. But, how is `g` different from `f`? If we had `g`, we could take its derivative with respect to `x` in O(1) time, without using `jax.jacgrad`. If we had `g`, we could also take its derivative with respect to `x` in O(1) time without using `jax.jacgrad`.\n\nComment: @user1998648 The difference is that `f` is a representation of a function. `g` is a representation of a function. The thing that makes `g` different from `f` is that `g` is a representation of a function that is optimized to be efficient, and `f` is a representation of the same function that is not optimized to be efficient.\n\nComment: So, I'm thinking about this in terms of the program. We have our program `f`. We have a function `g` that has the same input/output specifications as `f`, but is optimized to be efficient. `g`", "JAX is a library for writing differentiable programming. It provides a higher-level form of differentiation (called automatic differentiation), which makes it easy to write and optimize functions that compute gradients efficiently. It also provides a way to write functions that can be automatically differentiated.\n\nJAX is used for a wide range of applications, from machine learning to scientific computing. It is widely used in the research community and is being adopted by industry as well.\n\nJAX is not a replacement for PyTorch.

Designated space for mobility devices}\n\nThe problem with non-designated space is that when the bus is full, and everyone is standing, my mobility device is the first one to be moved so people can get on the bus. I once had to run to catch a bus because my mobility device was moved while I was still trying to get on the bus. I'm also afraid that the bus will leave before I get on.\n\n\\section{2. Announcements}\n\nThe bus stops should be announced so that blind people know where they are. This is very important for blind people who are using a mobility device because they are not able to see the bus stop.\n\n\\section{3. Braille}\n\nI think that bus stops should have Braille signs, so blind people who are not using a mobility device will know where they are.\n\n\\section{4. Blind people should be able to get help from the driver}\n\nIn my experience, the driver is usually very helpful because the driver knows that blind people can't see where they are.\n\n\\section{5. Elevators}\n\nI think that all public transportation stations should have elevators so that blind people can get to the platform.\n\n\\section{6. Mobility device charging stations}\n\nI think that all public transportation stations should have mobility device charging stations so that blind people can charge their mobility devices.\n\n\\section{7. Braille schedules}\n\nI think that all public transportation stations should have Braille schedules so that blind people can know when the next bus is coming.\n\n\\section{8.

{"prompt": "How can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions?", "response_list": ["\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe first and most obvious way that governments can use fiscal and monetary policies is by expanding the money supply through a variety of programs.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe two most direct ways governments do this is by buying bonds held by financial institutions. These bonds are typically short-term, so the government is forced to buy them back at a future date. This means that financial institutions have money now to lend out to businesses.\n\nThey can also expand the money supply by lowering the reserve requirements. This allows banks to lend out a greater portion of their deposits, which allows for a greater money supply.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nAnother way is by decreasing taxes and increasing expenditure. By decreasing taxes, the government allows people to keep more of their earnings. This allows them to spend more and thus drive the economy further. By increasing expenditure, the government stimulates the economy by spending more as well, allowing more money to flow through the economy.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nFinally, governments can use fiscal and monetary policies by implementing loan programs for business to use. Loan programs allow businesses to borrow money at a low interest rate, which allows them to expand and hire more workers.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: Thank you for the thorough explanation. I am familiar with the basic mechanisms of expansion through monetary and fiscal policies, but I am more interested in the nuances of how and when governments have used such policies to combat recessions. I would like to know more about the specific policies and mechanisms that have been used in the past.\n\nComment: So, what you're looking for is a list of fiscal and monetary policies used by governments to combat recessions?\n\nComment: Yes, specifically in the United States. I have read about the New Deal plan and the Great Society program, but I am not sure if there are any other programs or policies that have been used by the US government to combat recessions.", "The fiscal and monetary policies could be used to combat economic recessions in a number of ways, including:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Increasing government spending.\n\\item Reducing taxes.\n\\item Expanding the money supply.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: I'm not sure if this is relevant, but do monetary and fiscal policies work together? I've heard that they can but I can't find any info on that.\n\nComment: @EvelynMontoya: Fiscal and monetary policies can work together. For example, a government can lower taxes and raise spending, and can also raise the money supply to stimulate the economy.\n\nComment: I see, thank you.\n\nComment: @EvelynMontoya: You're welcome!", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nHow can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere are many forms of fiscal and monetary policies.  I'll describe a couple of the more common types.\n\n\\section{Fiscal Policy}\n\nFiscal policies are tax cuts or increases in government spending.  The idea is that if the government increases spending on infrastructure, or cuts taxes, the money will go to the citizens, and the citizens will spend it, which puts money in the pockets of business owners and workers.  These people will then spend their money, and the cycle repeats - hopefully spurring economic growth.\n\nAn example of fiscal policy was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the Stimulus Act.  This act was passed in response to the Great Recession which started in 2007.  The idea was that by cutting taxes, and increasing government spending, we would put money into the pockets of people, who would then spend it, which would help the economy get back on its feet.\n\n\\section{Monetary Policy}\n\nMonetary policy involves changing interest rates, which affects the availability of loans.  The idea is that if interest rates are low, banks will be more willing to loan money, and businesses will be able to borrow more money to invest in their business.  If interest rates are high, banks will loan less money, and businesses will be less able to borrow money for investments.\n\nIn 2008, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low, so that banks would be more willing to lend money.  In 2009, the Fed also bought large amounts of bonds on the open market, which is another way of saying that they bought U.S. treasury bonds from banks.  Buying bonds means that banks have more cash on hand, which gives them more money to lend.\n\nComment: I'm not sure about this, but I'd be inclined to say that there's some confusion here between fiscal and monetary policy and the effects of the Great Recession. For example, ARRA wasn't really spending (it was mostly tax cuts). It's not really clear that it had much of an impact on the economy (other than to stimulate some political careers) as the stimulus was mostly spent on debt repayment, and some of it was used to pay for tax cuts. The Fed's monetary policy (e.g. quantitative easing) also had little to do with the recession.\n\nComment: Also, the idea that tax cuts are good for the economy is largely discredited. And the idea that monetary policy can spur investment is also questionable, and not a direct result of interest rate changes.\n\nComment: @Alex Thanks for your comment. I've updated my answer to reflect what you've said. I'm not sure how you can say that monetary policy can't affect investment, though, since that's the whole point of the interest rate. Banks are much more willing to lend money when interest rates are low.\n\nComment: I would say that the idea that tax cuts are good for the economy is mostly discredited.  It's not that the idea has no merit - it does.  But it's generally not good policy.  Monetary policy can affect investment, but it's not as straightforward as what you're saying.  For example, the Fed is buying bonds from banks, which means that banks have more cash on hand, and they're more willing to lend.\n\nComment: I'm not sure if the Fed buying bonds from banks is a good thing or not.  It seems like the government is paying banks to do what they should be doing naturally.  I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with lowering interest rates, but I'm not sure that it's the most effective way to stimulate investment.  For example, some people say that interest rates should have been raised in 2003, to cool down the housing bubble.\n\nComment: \"Monetary policy can affect investment, but it's not as straightforward as what you're saying.\" I would say yes, it is straightforward. Interest rates affect investment decisions. That's why they're called interest rates.", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nHow can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat\n  economic recessions?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe US government is a fairly large employer. It can increase spending and hire people to work. That will increase the money supply, and help the economy.\n\nComment: How would increasing the money supply help the economy?\n\nComment: If you increase the money supply, that means you decrease the value of money, which makes it cheaper to buy stuff. So that increases demand, which increases production (which also employs people.)", "1) Tax Incentives - The government can give tax incentives to companies that employ people, which allows the companies to increase salaries.\n\n2) Expand Government Programs - The government can expand government programs such as unemployment benefits, which allows people to keep spending money.\n\n3) Monetary Policy\n\na) Lowering Interest Rates - Lowering interest rates makes it cheaper to borrow money. This allows companies to borrow money and expand their businesses, which allows them to hire more workers.\n\nb) Quantitative Easing - Quantitative easing is when the government purchases bonds (loans) from the Federal Reserve, which increases the money supply in the economy. This increases the money supply, which causes prices of goods and services to rise (inflation), and allows companies to expand their businesses and hire more workers.\n\nComment: I would be careful about the tax incentives. They are good in the short term to give the economy a boost but in the longer term they tend to distort incentives in the economy. This is why the Republicans in the US want to get rid of them."]}

I would look at the amount of work that is done in each module and then look at the amount of work that is done in the main function.  If the amount of work that is done in each module is less than the amount of work that is done in the main function, then you can probably eliminate the main function.  If it is more than the amount of work done in the main function, then you need to have the main function.  The key is to focus on the amount of work that is done.\n\nIn addition to the amount of work that is done, you should consider how much of the work that is done is done only once.  If a lot of the work is done only once, then the main function might be the best place to do it.\n\nMy suspicion is that it is hard to eliminate the main function in the way you are imagining.

See [this article](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a33239207/coronavirus-smell-sniffer-dogs-could-help-doctors-detect-covid-19/) for an example.

So, I can't speak with authority about the physiology of dogs.  However, I can speculate on the \"how\" and \"why\" of dogs sniffing out Covid19.\n\nThe \"how\" is that dogs can detect Covid19, because they have trained their noses to do so.  Humans have a terrible sense of smell, so we have to train our noses to detect things.  Dogs, on the other hand, have an excellent sense of smell, and their noses are already trained to do so.  We can train a human nose to detect Covid19, but we can't train a dog nose not to detect it.\n\nThe \"why\" is that Covid19 has a distinct smell.  Covid19 patients have detectable smells, and dogs can detect these smells.  Covid19 has a distinct smell because it has a distinct disease process.  The disease process produces detectable chemical signatures which are unique to Covid19.\n\nFor example, a person with Covid19 may have a different smell than a person with flu.  However, a person with flu will have a different smell than a person with Covid19.\n\nSo, Covid19 has a distinct smell in the same way that a cucumber has a distinct smell, or an apple has a distinct smell.  If we could build a machine that could detect the unique smell of Covid19, it would be no different than a machine that could detect the unique smell of an apple, or a cucumber.  The \"how\" is that it would be a machine that can detect unique smells.  The \"why\" is that the machine would be detecting the unique smell of Covid19.\n\nI am not aware of any machines that can detect the unique smell of Covid19.  If such a machine existed, it would probably be expensive and impractical, because it would be detecting a unique smell, not a unique disease process.  It would be like a machine that detects the unique smell of an apple, or a cucumber.\n\nI am also not aware of any machines that can detect a disease process.  A disease process is a state of health, not a smell.  A disease process may have a detectable smell, but it is the smell of the disease process, not the disease process itself.  Covid19 does not have a unique smell, it has a unique disease process.\n\nAnswer: Dogs are trained to smell disease. The Covid-19 virus is a disease and the dog's ability to smell it is a side effect of their training. Training them to detect the virus is like training them to detect a specific odor. There is no way to make it smell like anything other than what the dog is trained to smell. The dog's nose is trained to detect the disease, not the virus itself.\n\nComment: This answer is incorrect.

{"prompt": "Describe a scenario where artificial intelligence could be used to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery.", "response_list": ["\\section{AI in Healthcare}\n\nIn a paper published in 2018, M. Hosseini et al. proposed an AI-based healthcare system that aims to increase the efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery. The system was designed to be used in a hospital setting and would be based on a cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nThe system would be divided into three main components:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Data Collection:} The system would collect data from various sources, such as medical records, diagnostic imaging, and patient-reported outcomes.\n\\item \\strong{Data Analysis:} The system would use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends.\n\\item \\strong{Decision Support:} The system would use the analysis to provide doctors and patients with decision support, such as recommendations for treatment plans and personalized care plans.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe authors argue that this system would provide numerous benefits to the healthcare sector, including improved patient outcomes, reduced costs, and increased efficiency.\n\n\\section{Pros and Cons}\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare can have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, AI can help healthcare providers improve the quality and efficiency of their services by automating certain tasks and providing decision support. On the other hand, there are also concerns about the ethical implications of using AI in healthcare, such as the potential for discrimination, bias, and the loss of human touch.\n\n\\section{Ethical Considerations}\n\nOne of the key ethical considerations for using AI in healthcare is the potential for discrimination and bias. AI algorithms are trained on data sets, and if the data sets are not representative of the population or contain biased information, the algorithms may produce biased results. This could lead to unfair treatment of patients, particularly those from underrepresented groups.\n\nAnother ethical consideration is the potential for the loss of human touch in healthcare delivery. AI can help to automate certain tasks and provide decision support, but it cannot replicate the human element of healthcare. This could lead to a decrease in empathy and compassion in healthcare delivery, which could have negative consequences for patient outcomes.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare can have both positive and negative effects, and it is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of using AI in healthcare delivery. While AI can help improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare, it is important to ensure that the use of AI does not lead to discrimination or the loss of human touch in healthcare delivery.", "I'll mention one potential scenario that is not covered by the other answers.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in medicine is to get patients to follow their doctors' advice. For example, most patients don't take their medicine as prescribed and don't follow the dietary and exercise recommendations of their physicians.\n\nOne way to improve patient compliance with physicians' recommendations is to have an AI assistant that monitors patients remotely and sends reminders of medications and other recommendations.\n\nPatients who don't follow their doctors' advice are more likely to suffer complications and have worse outcomes. So improving patient compliance can have a major impact on healthcare quality and efficiency.\n\n[Here is](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6164602/) an example of a recent study on the impact of AI on improving patient compliance.\n\nComment: Thanks for the link, however this is not the answer I am looking for.

For example, AI can be used to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, to help doctors identify diseases. AI can also be used to help doctors provide treatment by giving them recommendations based on a patient's medical history and current condition.\n\nAnswer: The biggest example of AI improving healthcare quality and efficiency is the use of electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are digital versions of a patient's medical history that can be accessed by authorized healthcare providers.\n\nEHRs have several benefits for both patients and healthcare providers. For patients, EHRs can improve the quality of care by ensuring that all of their relevant medical information is readily available to healthcare providers. This can help to prevent medication errors, reduce the risk of duplicate tests, and provide a more comprehensive picture of a patient's health.\n\nFor healthcare providers, EHRs can improve efficiency by streamlining the process of accessing and sharing patient information. This can save time and reduce the risk of errors. EHRs can also help to improve quality by providing real-time alerts when patients are at risk for certain conditions or when they are due for a preventive screening.\n\nAnswer: Artificial intelligence can improve healthcare quality and efficiency by providing a more accurate and efficient way to diagnose patients.

{"prompt": "How do vaccinations work to protect individuals and communities from infectious diseases, and what is herd immunity?", "response_list": ["Vaccinations work, by giving a weakened or dead copy of the virus or bacteria to the individual, which is then recognized by the immune system and a response to the pathogen is made. The response is usually an antibody, but can also be a cellular response. The response is stored, so if the pathogen comes back in the future, the immune system can detect it and mount a response. Vaccines are usually given by injection, but can also be given orally, and also via a nasal spray.\n\nThe problem with vaccines is that if they are given to too many people, the vaccine loses its effectiveness. This is called herd immunity, and a certain percentage of the population needs to have vaccines in order for the vaccine to be effective. The problem with vaccines is that you can only give them to a certain population, and there is a certain percentage of individuals who cannot be vaccinated. So, if you have 90% of the population vaccinated, then you can reach herd immunity, but if you have 100% of the population vaccinated, then you have to vaccinate the 10% who cannot be vaccinated, so the vaccine will not reach herd immunity.\n\nThe problem with vaccines is that if you are exposed to a pathogen, you can become infected and die. If you are exposed to a pathogen, you can be vaccinated, but not get the vaccine, and be exposed to the pathogen. If you are exposed to a pathogen, you can be vaccinated, but not get the vaccine, and be exposed to the pathogen.

These antibodies can then fight off the infectious agents (usually viruses or bacteria) that cause the disease. In most cases, the immunity lasts for a number of years, but in some cases, such as the flu, the immunity lasts only a year.\n\nHerd immunity is a concept in which a large percentage of the population is immune to a disease, making it harder for the disease to spread. For example, if 90% of people have vaccinations against a disease, then the disease can't easily find a new host.\n\nComment: Is there a way to cite this answer?

Maybe you could tell me how to do it, and I can work it into my answer.  If not, I hope someone else can do it.", "To answer the question of how vaccinations work, we start with the question of how infectious diseases work.\n\nFirst of all, many infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and viruses are quite different from bacteria, which are themselves different from archaea, which are themselves different from protists, and so on.  A virus is not a living thing.  A virus is a particle, and that particle is surrounded by a membrane.  The membrane is made of a type of lipid, and that lipid is surrounded by proteins.  The virus particles are called virions.\n\nMost virions are so small that they can only be seen with an electron microscope.  The smallest viruses are called viruses, and the largest ones are called viruses, and the size of both groups of virions varies substantially.  For example, the smallest viruses, such as bacteriophages, have a diameter of less than 0.05 microns, and the largest viruses, such as the largest poxviruses, have a diameter of about 0.4 microns.  In comparison, the smallest bacteria have a diameter of about 0.1 microns, and the largest bacteria have a diameter of about 10 microns.\n\nThe smallest viruses are called viruses, and the largest viruses are called viruses, and the sizes of both groups of virions vary substantially.  The largest viruses, such as the largest poxviruses, have a diameter of about 0.4 microns, and the largest viruses, such as the largest poxviruses, have a diameter of about 0.5 microns.

If you ever get infected with the disease, your immune system has already seen that disease in a weakened form, and can respond quickly to defeat it.\n\nThe antibodies the immune system makes are proteins that specifically bind to the disease-causing virus or bacteria, and prevent it from infecting other cells.\n\nVaccines are the only way to prevent disease, because once you have a disease, it's too late.\n\nThere's a lot of details to the immune system and how it works that could be discussed, but those are at the heart of it.\n\nAnswer: Vaccines work by introducing antigens into the bloodstream that the immune system sees as a threat, which causes it to make antibodies against those antigens. These antibodies then exist in the body and if the person is ever exposed to the antigens again, the antibodies bind to them and destroy them before they can cause any damage.\n\nHere is a link for a more detailed explanation of how vaccines work: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vaccine-basics/how-vaccines-work.html\n\nComment: Welcome to the site.\n\nComment: Thank you!\n\nAnswer: Vaccines are designed to prepare the immune system to attack a pathogen. It is a complex process, but the basic idea is:\n\n1) Vaccines are made from either inactivated pathogens, or antigens that are used to generate an immune response.\n\n2) When a vaccine is administered, the antigen will bind to specific receptors on white blood cells.\n\n3) The white blood cells will activate and produce antibodies that will bind to the antigen.\n\n4) The antibodies produced by the white blood cells will attack the antigens if they re-encounter it.\n\nHope that makes sense.\n\nComment: Welcome to the site.  This might be more useful if you linked to sources of your information.\n\nComment: This is not a bad answer, but it's not an answer to the question about how vaccines work.  A \"vaccine\" is not necessarily an antigen, nor does the \"immune system\" necessarily produce antibodies.  This is an answer to the question \"What is a vaccine?\" and \"How does the immune system work?\"\n\nAnswer: Vaccines are designed to be weakened versions of a disease-causing agent such as a bacteria or virus, or a toxin produced by a pathogen.  When a vaccine is administered, the body's immune system will identify the pathogen or toxin and produce antibodies to it.\n\nIf the person is ever exposed to the disease-causing agent, the body will have already produced antibodies to destroy it before it can cause any harm.\n\nAnswer: Vaccines are administered in the hope that they will mimic a natural infection, and thus stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against the infectious organism. These antibodies can then neutralize the organism if it is encountered in the future."]}

They can make it easier for people to access and share information, but they can also contribute to the spread of misinformation.\n\nOne way that social media platforms can influence the way people consume news is by recommending content to users based on their interests and past activity. This can help people to discover new sources of information and to explore topics that they are interested in. However, this can also lead to people being exposed to a wider range of sources of information, some of which may be more likely to contain misinformation.\n\nAnother way that social media platforms can influence the way people consume news is by allowing users to share and discuss content with others.

For example, it can lead to the spread of false or misleading information about health and safety issues, political and social issues, and other important topics. This can lead to confusion and misinformation, which can have a negative impact on society as a whole.\n\nTo address the spread of misinformation on social media platforms, many platforms have implemented measures such as fact-checking, labeling of false or misleading content, and other tools to help users make informed decisions about the content they consume.

This has meant that traditional methods of news, such as print media and television, have become less popular.\n\nThis is especially true for younger people who are more likely to get their news from online sources. In fact, a survey by the Pew Research Center found that 48% of young people aged 18-29 get their news from social media.\n\nThe rise of social media has also led to a change in the way people share news.

This has led to a rise in the spread of misinformation as people are more likely to share news that they find interesting or controversial, even if it is not accurate.\n\nThis problem has become more acute in recent years as social media platforms have become more popular.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for this. First, social media platforms are often designed to be addictive, which means that people are more likely to use them for extended periods of time.\n\nSecond, social media platforms are often used to share information with people who are not friends or family, which can lead to the spread of misinformation.\n\nFinally, social media platforms are often used to share information about controversial topics, which can lead to the spread of misinformation.\n\nSocial media platforms can be a valuable tool for sharing news and information, but it is important to be aware of the potential risks involved.\n\nPeople can take a number of steps to minimize the risk of spreading misinformation on social media.\n\nFirst, people should be careful about the sources of information that they share.

In fact, according to a recent study by Pew Research Center, more than half of American adults (55%) now get their news from social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And while this trend is certainly convenient for news consumers, it also has some serious implications for the spread of misinformation.\n\nThe way people consume and share news on social media platforms is often very different from traditional methods. For instance, on social media platforms, news stories are often shared without any context or verification, which can lead to the spread of misinformation. What\u2019s more, the algorithms that power social media platforms are designed to keep users engaged and encourage them to spend more time on the platform, which often results in the promotion of sensational or controversial news stories.\n\nThe potential implications of this trend are serious. The spread of misinformation can have a number of negative effects, from causing people to make uninformed decisions to sowing division and discord in society. And while there are efforts to combat the spread of misinformation on social media platforms, such as fact-checking initiatives and increased transparency, the problem is likely to continue.", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\strong{Abstract}\n\nThis paper examines news sharing on social media, using data from Twitter. The data set is a sample of 467,223 tweets containing links to news articles. Three key findings are: (1) Sharing of news on Twitter is highly selective. The news shared by a typical user has a very high average number of retweets, but is highly biased, such that a single retweeted news story is likely to be viewed by many people, but the number of users who have viewed the next most popular story is likely to be much smaller. (2) The most popular stories are more likely to be shared by users who are more active, and who tweet more often. (3) The distribution of news articles shared via Twitter is strongly biased towards topics that are more salient to users\u2014i.e., topics that are popular or newsworthy.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\strong{From the Introduction}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe social media platforms of our era are fundamentally different in many ways from the broadcast media of the 20th century. In particular, they have opened up the possibility for the general public to participate in the creation of content and act as publishers. The public\u2019s ability to share news is now almost ubiquitous. This has important implications for the potential for the spread of misinformation. In this paper, we examine the spread of news on the social media platform Twitter. Twitter is a micro-blogging platform, where users post messages (known as \u201ctweets\u201d) of 140 characters or less. Users can \u201cretweet\u201d (RT) a tweet, which essentially forwards it to their followers. Twitter provides a convenient way for the public to share news, as users can easily tweet links to news articles.\n\nWe examine a sample of 467,223 tweets containing links to news articles. Our data set is a subset of the 2014 Twitter API archive, and is limited to tweets posted by users who are located in the United States. To obtain a sample of news articles shared by Twitter users, we extract all tweets that contain links to news articles. In particular, we consider tweets that include a link to an article posted to a site hosted by a major news outlet (e.g., nytimes.com, washingtonpost.com, etc). We obtained information on the popularity of articles from Twitter\u2019s API, which includes information on the total number of retweets (RTs) of a tweeted article link. The popularity of news articles on Twitter is highly skewed, with a small number of articles receiving a large number of retweets. For instance, 51% of all news articles have fewer than 5 RTs; 90% have fewer than 100. On the other hand, 9% of articles have more than 1000 RTs, and 1% of articles have more than 10,000.\n\nWe examine the social media sharing of news in a number of different ways. First, we examine the extent to which news sharing is biased. We find that the news shared by a typical user has a very high average number of retweets, but is highly biased, such that a single retweeted news story is likely to be viewed by many people, but the number of users who have viewed the next most popular story is likely to be much smaller. In particular, for a typical user, the 90th percentile of news articles shares is 16.1 times the median.\n\nSecond, we examine the relationship between the number of retweets of an article and the popularity of the user who shares it. We find that the most popular stories are more likely to be shared by users who are more active, and who tweet more often.\n\nThird, we examine whether the distribution of news articles on Twitter is skewed towards topics that are more salient to users. In particular, we examine whether the content of articles shared on Twitter is biased towards topics that are popular or newsworthy. We examine the popularity of news articles across a number of different dimensions. We find that the distribution of news articles shared via Twitter is strongly biased towards topics that are more salient to users\u2014i.e., topics that are popular or newsworthy. In particular, we find that news articles shared by users are more popular than articles not shared by users in four different dimensions that we examine, including the number of RTs, the number of users who have \u201cf"]}

In addition, the abundance of cheap, high-calorie foods has been associated with unhealthy dietary practices among lower-income Americans. However, the availability of healthful foods is also an important factor influencing healthy eating. Increasingly, urban areas are experiencing a lack of access to fresh, healthy foods, and this lack of access is correlated with higher rates of obesity and related chronic illnesses. Furthermore, the consumption of fast foods and highly processed foods has been linked with higher rates of obesity, particularly among low-income populations who may not have access to a variety of healthy foods.\n\nMore broadly, societal norms and cultural values can influence individuals' food choices and eating habits. For example, some cultures place a high value on food and eating, while others may prioritize other aspects of life. This can lead to differences in food preparation, consumption habits, and attitudes towards food. Additionally, social norms and cultural expectations can shape how individuals view their own body image and their relationship with food, which in turn can affect their food choices and eating habits.\n\nFurthermore, the perception of healthy eating can be influenced by various factors such as advertising, marketing, and public health campaigns. These factors can shape individuals' understanding of what constitutes a healthy diet and may lead to unhealthy eating practices.\n\nIn conclusion, cultural, social, and economic factors play an important role in influencing people's food choices and eating habits. Understanding these factors is critical for developing effective strategies to promote healthy eating habits.\u201d\n\nComment: Thank you for answering my question :)\n\nComment: You're welcome, no prob :)", "Food is a cultural symbol, a signifier of social status.

{"prompt": "Explain the process of natural selection and how it contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species.", "response_list": ["Natural selection is all about differential reproduction, where the organisms that are better equipped to cope with the environment are more likely to have more offspring than the less fit organisms.\n\nThe fit organisms are better equipped to reproduce because they have more food, more shelter, more mates, or because they have some other trait that is advantageous to them in the environment.  The more successful organisms are then able to pass on that trait to their offspring, which is why natural selection often results in adaptation to the environment.\n\nThe process of natural selection is complex and can involve many different factors, such as genetic drift, sexual selection, and gene flow.  The overall result of natural selection is that species can adapt to the environment, leading to the diversity of life that we see today.\n\nComment: The answer would be better if you provided references and sources.", "Natural selection is the process by which heritable traits that enhance an individual\u2019s ability to survive and reproduce to pass those traits on to the next generation.\n\nSome heritable traits are more beneficial than others.

This leads to a gradual change in the characteristics of a population over time, as the genes for those characteristics are passed on to future generations.\n\nOne way that natural selection contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species is by favoring genetic variations that provide an advantage to the organism. For example, if a certain mutation causes an organism to develop a trait that helps it to survive in its environment, that mutation is more likely to be passed on to future generations and become more common in the population. Over time, this can lead to the development of new species or subspecies with different characteristics than the original population.\n\nNatural selection can also work in combination with other evolutionary forces, such as genetic drift and sexual selection, to shape the evolution of species. For example, genetic drift can cause random fluctuations in the frequency of certain genetic variants within a population, while sexual selection can favor certain traits that make an organism more attractive to potential mates.\n\nIt's important to note that natural selection is not the only factor that determines the evolution and adaptation of species. Other factors, such as environmental changes and migration, can also play a role in shaping the evolution of a population.\n\nAnswer: Natural selection is a powerful force that drives evolution and adaptation. It occurs when individuals in a population vary in their characteristics and those differences influence their ability to survive and reproduce. The individuals with the most favorable traits are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation, while those with less favorable traits are less likely to reproduce and their genes are less likely to be passed on. Over time, this process results in a population that is better adapted to its environment and more likely to survive and thrive.\n\nOne of the key ways that natural selection contributes to the evolution and adaptation of species is through the process of differential reproductive success. This occurs when individuals with certain traits are more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes to the next generation, while individuals with less favorable traits are less likely to reproduce and their genes are less likely to be passed on. For example, in a population of birds, individuals with longer bills may be better able to reach into deep flowers to get nectar, while individuals with shorter bills may not be able to reach the nectar and may not reproduce as successfully. Over time, the individuals with longer bills are more likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation, while the individuals with shorter bills are less likely to reproduce and their genes are less likely to be passed on. This process of differential reproductive success can lead to changes in the population's characteristics over time, resulting in a population that is better adapted to its environment.\n\nNatural selection also plays a role in the evolution of new species. When a population is divided into two or more groups, each group may experience different environmental pressures, leading to differences in the traits that are favored by natural selection in each group. Over time, these differences may lead to the formation of two or more distinct species with different characteristics. For example, if a population of birds is split into two groups, one living in a forest and one living in a desert, the birds in each group may experience different pressures, such as the need for stronger wings in the forest group and the need for longer legs in the desert group. Over time, these differences may lead to the formation of two distinct species, each with traits that are better adapted to its environment.\n\nIt's important to note that natural selection is not the only factor that drives evolution and adaptation. Other factors, such as genetic mutations, can also play a role in shaping the characteristics of a population over time. However, natural selection is a powerful and important force that can lead to significant changes in a population's characteristics and can ultimately result in the evolution of new species.", "Natural selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass along their genes to future generations. Over time, this process can lead to the evolution of new species and the adaptation of existing species to changing environmental conditions.\n\nNatural selection works by favoring certain traits over others. For example, if a species lives in an environment where there is a lot of predation, individuals with traits that help them avoid predators (such as speed, camouflage, or the ability to hide) are more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals without those traits. Over time, the population as a whole will tend to exhibit these traits more and more, as they are passed down from generation to generation.\n\nIn addition to predation, other factors can also influence natural selection. For example, competition for resources can favor individuals with traits that allow them to obtain more food or shelter. Climate change can also lead to the evolution of new traits, such as the ability to adapt to new climates or to withstand changes in temperature or precipitation.\n\nNatural selection is a powerful force in shaping the evolution of life on Earth, and it continues to play a role in the adaptation of species to changing environmental conditions. By understanding the process of natural selection, we can gain insight into the ways in which life has evolved and adapted over time, and how it may continue to do so in the future.\n\nAnswer: Natural selection is a process in which organisms with genetic traits that make them better suited to their environment have a greater chance of survival and reproduction than organisms with less suited traits. This results in a gradual change in the genetic makeup of the population over time.\n\nThe process of natural selection involves the following steps:\n\n1. Overproduction: Organisms produce more offspring than can survive and reproduce in the environment.\n\n2. Variation: Individuals within a species exhibit genetic variations that give them different traits.\n\n3. Competition: Individuals compete with one another for limited resources such as food, water, and shelter.\n\n4. Survival of the fittest: Those individuals with traits that are better suited to the environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to future generations.\n\n5. Genetic drift: Random changes in the gene pool can occur due to events such as mutations, genetic drift, or founder effects, which can lead to the emergence of new species.\n\nOver time, this process results in the gradual change in the genetic makeup of a population, leading to the evolution of new species.\n\nAnswer: Natural selection is the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass along their genes to future generations.

The quarterback looked left and right but he didn't see any open receivers. The clock was ticking down and he was running out of time. The line broke down and the quarterback was sacked. The quarterback was in great fear of getting injured but he had to stay in the play. He got up and ran to the sideline.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is a narrative approach which describes the action in great detail. The reader is taken through the play from start to finish.

We are already in space, and Mars is just a more extreme version of space.\n\nThe challenges we face living on Mars are very similar to the challenges we face living on Earth. We face challenges like food, water, shelter and safety just like on Earth. The only difference is that on Mars we have to be more careful and prepared when it comes to these things.\n\nFor example, on Mars we have to be careful when it comes to food. We have to make sure that the food is safe to eat and that it won't make us sick. We also have to make sure that we have enough food to last us for a long time.\n\nAnother challenge we face on Mars is water. On Mars, there isn't much water, and what there is is very cold. This means that we have to be careful when it comes to using water. We also have to make sure that we have enough water to last us for a long time.\n\nShelter is also a challenge on Mars. On Earth, we have buildings and homes to protect us from the elements. On Mars, we have to make sure that we have a shelter that will protect us from the harsh climate.\n\nSafety is also a challenge on Mars. On Earth, we have law enforcement and other organizations to keep us safe. On Mars, we have to be careful and make sure that we don't get into any kind of trouble.\n\nOverall, living on Mars is no different than living on Earth. We face the same challenges, we just have to be more careful and prepared when it comes to them.\n\nComment: I find this a rather unhelpful answer, as it doesn't really answer the question.\n\nComment: @user15502538: I agree.

I have to go to the lab everyday to work on experiments to help us learn how to live here permanently, and there isn't much to do outside the lab, but there are some movies to watch and things like that. The food we have is pretty good, and it's good to know that we are trying to grow food here, but it is a long way off.

It came silently, as I was too busy trying to keep my eyes open. The storm was a welcome relief from the oppressive heat, and the rain provided much needed water. It was only when the sun began to set and the darkness began to fall that I realized what had happened. I was alone in a world where no one else existed.\n\nI screamed, but there was no one to hear it. And then I began to cry, because I was so tired. I had run for days, my body aching and my lungs burning. I had started out with a group of other survivors, but one by one they had dropped off until I was the only one left.\n\nI didn't know how long I had been alone, but it felt like forever. I had no idea where I was or how to get back home. I just knew that I had to keep moving, because the night was coming and with it the darkness.\n\nI stumbled through the night, my eyes burning from the lack of sleep. I was so tired that I couldn't even think straight. And then I saw it. A light in the distance. I couldn't believe it. A light in the darkness. I knew that I had to reach it, so I pushed on.\n\nAs I got closer, I could see that the light was coming from a house. A house that was surrounded by a fence. A fence that was topped with razor wire. I knew that I couldn't get in. But I also knew that I couldn't keep moving in the night. So I started to climb the fence.\n\nAs I climbed, I could see that the house was abandoned. The windows were broken and the door was hanging off its hinges. But there was a light on inside. And it was a light that I needed.\n\nI made it over the top of the fence and into the yard. I went to the door and tried to open it, but it was locked. I kicked it a few times, but it didn't budge. So I went around to the back.\n\nThere was a window there that was open. I climbed in and found myself in a small room that was cluttered with junk. But there was a light switch on the wall, and I flipped it on.\n\nThe light revealed a man sitting in a chair. He was old and frail, and he was wearing a dirty white lab coat. He looked up at me and said, \"Who are you?\"\n\nI said, \"I'm a survivor. I need your help.\"\n\nHe nodded and said, \"I can help you. But first, you have to answer a question.\"\n\nI said, \"What is it?\"\n\nHe said, \"How do you know that I'm not a monster?\"\n\nI said, \"I don't. But I also don't know that you're not a monster. So I'll take my chances.\"\n\nHe nodded and said, \"Fair enough. Now, let me show you what I have.\"\n\nHe stood up and went to a closet. He opened it and revealed a small arsenal of weapons. He said, \"These are my weapons. I've been waiting for someone like you to come along. Someone who needs them.\"\n\nI said, \"I need them. But I need food and water too. Can you help me with that?\"\n\nHe nodded and said, \"Of course. Follow me.\"\n\nHe led me through the house to the kitchen. He opened the fridge and said, \"This should be enough to get you started.\"\n\nI said, \"Thank you. I don't know what to say.\"\n\nHe said, \"You don't have to say anything. Just be grateful. And don't forget who your allies are.\"\n\nHe reached into his pocket and pulled out a business card. He handed it to me and said, \"If you ever need anything else, just call this number.\"\n\nI took the card and said, \"Thank you again. I'll be sure to call if I need anything else.\"\n\nHe nodded and said, \"I hope so. It's been a long time since I've had a call like that.\"\n\nI left the house and made my way back to the fence.

Can you elaborate on that part?", "If you don't mind the extra expense, you could try checking out sites like TripAdvisor and Yelp, as they tend to have an average rating from a large number of people.\n\nHowever, if you are on a budget, you could try to find a local newspaper or a small local magazine. Most of these are online nowadays, so you could try to find the reviews in them.\n\nIn short, you could try to find a place where people can leave reviews, and see if you can find a large number of reviews.\n\nComment: I didn't know about Yelp. I thought it was just for US. I'll have to check it out.\n\nComment: Yelp is for any place in the world.

A restaurant that has many positive reviews from locals is likely to be a good choice. However, it is important to keep in mind that not all reviews are created equal, and some may be biased or motivated by other factors. It is also a good idea to look for a variety of sources, such as social media and local newspapers, to get a more well-rounded view of the restaurant's reputation.\n\nAnother way to determine if a restaurant is popular among locals is to ask locals themselves or read local blogs and forums. This can give you a sense of what the restaurant is like and whether it is a popular choice among locals.\n\nFinally, you can also consider the location of the restaurant and its surroundings. If the restaurant is located in a touristy area, it is likely to attract more tourists than locals. However, if the restaurant is located in a more residential area, it is more likely to be popular among locals.\n\nOverall, it is important to consider a variety of factors when determining if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists. A combination of online reviews, locals' opinions, and the location of the restaurant can give you a good idea of the restaurant's popularity among locals.\n\nComment: Thank you so much, I appreciate your help!", "I have a friend who told me a very simple way to tell if a restaurant is popular with locals.

I've found that restaurants with lines at lunch have a certain smell of authenticity, and it's also a good indicator of the quality of the food.\n\nIf you want to find more specific information, I would suggest a search engine like Google or Bing. You can also try asking on Reddit or Quora, which are popular sites for asking questions and getting answers from other people.\n\nOne of the best ways to determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists is to ask people who live in the area. Look for a local business that offers reviews for restaurants, or ask a local friend or colleague.\n\nThere are also websites that rank restaurants based on how many locals visit them. One such site is Yelp, which allows users to rate and review restaurants.\n\nFinally, you can always try to look for popular restaurants by looking at the menu. If the prices are high, the food is probably more expensive than what you would expect from a tourist trap.\n\nComment: Your answer could be improved with additional supporting information.

you're looking for is one that I've heard often called a 'Smile and Nod'.  This is where someone's just nodding and smiling, to show that they're listening and understanding.  When you ask about the topic, they just keep smiling and nodding, and maybe shake their head 'yes' or 'no', but can't actually answer the question.\n\nIn my experience, this is mostly seen in people who are not native speakers of the language (or even people who are native speakers).  This is because they've been exposed to the language often enough to be able to nod and smile, but not quite enough to be able to respond to questions.\n\nI think the best way to handle this is to try to understand the situation in which the 'Smile and Nod' is occurring.  If you're in a job where you're forced to nod and smile (to appear like you understand something), then I think you should ask your boss to help you understand the topic.  If you're in an informal situation, then I think you should be able to ask the person 'Smile and Nodding' about what they don't understand, and help them understand.\n\nComment: I've had a few friends who nod and smile because they're trying to think of something to say.  They're not going to ask for clarification, they just want to move the conversation along.\n\nComment: I've seen this in the workplace.  I think it's just not wanting to 'let others down'.  I've seen it with both coworkers and bosses.  If you're a boss, it's especially bad, because then you're forcing other people to nod and smile.\n\nComment: I've seen this in the workplace, too.  I think it's just the natural desire to be liked, and the natural fear of being embarrassed for not knowing something.  There's no shame in not knowing something, and there's no reason to be embarrassed about it.  If you don't know something, just ask for help.\n\nComment: That is a good term and exactly what I was looking for. I think the best way to handle this is to just ask the person to explain what they don't understand and help them understand.\n\nComment: Yeah, I think that's the best way to handle it.  It's hard to know if someone's just nodding and smiling because they don't understand, or if they're just trying to avoid embarrassment.  But if you can get them to explain what they don't understand, then you can probably help them understand it.  I think it's just a matter of asking for clarification.\n\nAnswer: I think the best way to handle this is to just ask the person to explain what they don't understand and help them understand.\n\nComment: I would add that you should be careful not to make the person feel bad for not understanding.

And if you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask for clarification.\n\nComment: I think if you're in a workplace situation, it's best to just ask for clarification and help the person understand.

You had a good idea of what it was like.  So for some things, this is probably a good enough answer.  For others, the person who hasn't done it has no idea at all.

I'm not trying to find an answer that makes me look smart.\n\nAnswer: It's not always the things they say, but how they say them.  If they are saying things that don't make sense or are illogical, then they are faking it.  If they are saying things that make sense and are logical, then they are probably not faking it.\n\nI think it is a good idea to ask a question that requires a little bit of thinking, and then listen carefully to how they respond.

These are phones, tablets, cars, watches, etc.  All you need to do is turn it on.  Many of these devices also have software which takes the position data and puts it on a map.  In the case of a phone, this software may be a built-in application, or an app which you have installed.\n\nSome consumer products have GPS receivers built into them.  These are mostly for special applications, and are generally not intended for general use.  These are things like drones, boats, planes, etc.  These products need the GPS receiver built in to them so that they can use the data from the satellites.\n\nYou can also buy a standalone GPS receiver, such as for use in a car, boat, or plane.  These are not consumer products.  They are built to withstand the environment of the vehicle and to do the job of getting position data from the satellites for the vehicle.  These products are not intended for general use.  They are intended for special applications.\n\nIf you want to use a standalone GPS receiver, you need to get software to do something with the position data.  You could use a phone or tablet to do this, or you could get specialized software for the purpose.  You could use a laptop, or you could get a dedicated portable GPS computer.\n\nWhy would you want to use a standalone GPS receiver instead of using your phone or tablet?  You could do the same thing on a phone or tablet, so why would you use a specialized receiver?  The answer is that you can get the position data without the phone or tablet needing to be turned on.  The GPS receiver is getting the position data, and then passing it on to the phone or tablet to use.  In this case, the phone or tablet doesn't need to be turned on, and it doesn't need to be running software to get the position data.  This can be useful if you want a device which is always working to get the position data for you.\n\nComment: \"There is no such thing as a GPS device, only receivers.\"  Well, actually, there is.

For example, you can look at the source's reputation, the author's credentials, the publication's history, and the overall tone of the article.\n\nBut what if you want to go beyond these factors and actually assess the credibility of the information itself? How can you do that without relying solely on the reputation of the author or publisher?\n\nOne way is to look at the sources that the article cites.

I have edited my answer to address that issue.\n\nAnswer: You can check the sources that the article cites. If they are reputable sources, then the article is likely to be reputable as well. You can also look at the author's credentials and see if they have any relevant experience or expertise in the topic they are writing about. Additionally, you can check the publication history of the article to see if it has been published in a reputable journal or magazine.

All of these methods are not perfect, but they can still help us to assess the credibility of a source.\n\nComment: Yes, and I was just trying to make the point that there is no one-size-fits-all method for assessing credibility.

Some people have a fear of being scared, which they may have developed from childhood or as an adult. Some people are insecure about themselves and their emotions, and may fear that they will be uncontrollable if they allow themselves to be scared. Some people may have been traumatized in the past by something that was scary, and have learned to avoid anything that reminds them of it. Some people may just not find being scared to be enjoyable.\n\nComment: If you have a fear of being scared, you are not scared.

For example, if someone is afraid of being scared, that would be a fear of a specific emotion, which is not the same thing as being scared.\n\nComment: @Sycorax: If you are afraid of being scared, it means that you are not only afraid of the thing that is scaring you, but you are also afraid of the *emotion* of being scared. You are basically afraid of the feeling of fear. So, for example, you might be afraid of the feeling of being afraid, but not afraid of the specific thing that is causing the fear.\n\nComment: @Sycorax: Being afraid is a general emotion that can be caused by many different things, including things that are not specifically threatening.

It is a personality trait.\n\nIn general, there are two types of risk preferences:  risk-averse and risk-neutral.\n\nRisk-averse people prefer to avoid risk. Such people enjoy a safe environment. They will not even take a little risk in order to get more profit, for example.\n\nRisk-neutral people are not affected by the risk. They can take a risk in order to get more profit. For example, they can spend their entire savings in buying a new car.\n\nRisk-seeking people seek risk. It is similar to risk-neutral people but they actually prefer to take more risk. They can even put their entire savings at risk in order to get more profit. For example, they can invest their entire savings in a small startup business.\n\nThe same people can be risk-averse in one area and risk-seeking in another area. For example, a person can be risk-averse in investment in stocks but risk-seeking in playing poker.\n\nThe tendency for risk-seeking is the opposite of risk-averse for the same task.\n\nRisk preference is not binary, but rather, it is a continuum.

We explored our planet with primitive tools and eventually grew into a civilization that allowed us to do so with much more advanced technology. We have a fundamental desire to explore and understand what is beyond our planet.\n\nI think that this desire for exploration is a core part of the human experience. If we don't explore, we will stagnate. Our civilization will wither away and eventually be replaced by a more progressive one.\n\n\\section{Why we should solve Earth's problems first}\n\nHumanity is facing some very serious problems, and we need to solve them before we can focus on space exploration. We need to clean up our environment, deal with climate change, and address the growing inequality between the rich and the poor.\n\nWe need to focus on these problems first, because they are the most immediate threats to our civilization. If we don't solve them, then we will be in a much worse position to explore space.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe have a moral obligation to explore space, and we should focus on solving Earth's problems first. We need to explore space in order to grow as a civilization, but we also need to solve Earth's problems in order to ensure that we are around to do so.\n\nWe should use our resources to solve Earth's problems first, and then we can use them to explore space. We can do both, and we should do both.\n\nComment: Great answer. This is the first time I've thought about the possibility that we have to solve our problems here first before we're ready to explore space. I also like the idea of using space exploration to spur humanity to solve our problems.\n\nComment: Great answer - I'd upvote it if I didn't have a reputation of 1.\n\nComment: I like the idea of using space exploration to spur humanity to solve our problems. I think that many people are pessimistic about our ability to solve our problems, but I think that if we focus on space exploration, it will be easier to come together and solve our problems.\n\nAnswer: You have a moral obligation to solve our problems first.\n\nSpace exploration is not a moral imperative. It is a scientific imperative and a national security imperative. We should be exploring space because we are explorers and because we can. We should not be exploring space because it is cheap or easy, or to get rich quick.\n\nThe question is a false dichotomy. We should be doing both - focusing on the problems here on Earth while simultaneously exploring space.\n\nComment: This is a great answer. I'd upvote it if I didn't have a reputation of 1.\n\nComment: I agree that we should be doing both, but I believe that we should be exploring space now, and not wait until we have solved all of our problems on Earth. I think that exploring space will help us solve our problems on Earth, and that we need to explore space in order to grow as a civilization.\n\nComment: I agree that exploring space will help us solve our problems on Earth, but I believe that we should be solving our problems on Earth first, and then exploring space. I think that exploring space now, without solving our problems on Earth, is irresponsible.\n\nComment: I agree that we should be exploring space. I just believe that we should be solving our problems on Earth first, and then exploring space. I think that exploring space now, without solving our problems on Earth, is irresponsible.\n\nComment: I agree that solving our problems on Earth first, and then exploring space is the best way to go about things. I think that exploring space now, without solving our problems on Earth, is irresponsible.\n\nAnswer: \\section{It depends on the problem}\n\nIn general, I believe that we should focus on solving Earth's problems first. However, there are some problems that we can address more effectively by exploring space. For example, if we want to solve the problem of climate change, we need to explore space in order to find new energy sources.\n\nWe should focus on these problems first, because they are the most immediate threats to our civilization. If we don't solve them, then we will be in a much worse position to explore", "My take is that we have both an obligation and an opportunity.\n\nThe obligation is to preserve our own species.\n\nThe opportunity is to better understand the nature of the universe and to provide humanity with the resources necessary to preserve our species.\n\nI see this as an opportunity but an obligation as well.\n\nComment: I agree, and it might be interesting to note that the human lifespan is a very small part of the lifespan of the Earth. We are only here a short time, so we've got a lot to do.\n\nComment: I don't think that the OP is asking about the survival of our species. It is not clear whether he is asking about moral obligation to humanity in general, or about moral obligation to mankind as a whole.", "The question you pose is not really a scientific one, but a philosophical one.\n\nThe question of whether we have a moral obligation to explore space or not is a question of ethics. The first step to answering this question is to define what exactly we mean by \"moral obligation\". Do we mean that it is right to explore space, but wrong not to? Or do we mean that we have a duty to explore space?\n\nThose definitions are quite different, as is illustrated by the following examples:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Is it wrong to eat meat?\n\\item Do we have a duty to eat meat?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIn the first case, you might say that it is quite wrong to eat meat, especially if you are vegan. In the second case, you might say that we have no duty to eat meat, but that we do have a duty to eat. Of course, you can answer the second question by saying that we don't have a duty to eat, but that we should eat (which is the same as saying it is right to eat).\n\nIf we say that we have a moral obligation (a duty) to explore space, then it would mean that we should explore space, even if we did not really want to.\n\nIn the case of exploring space, we could ask the following: if we were to stop exploring space, would we have committed a moral wrong? I would argue that we would not have any moral wrong by stopping to explore space, since there is no duty to explore space.\n\nBut we could also ask the following: if we were to stop exploring space, would we have failed to fulfill our duty? I would argue that we would not have failed to fulfill our duty by stopping to explore space, since there is no duty to explore space.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that there is no moral wrong in stopping to explore space, and that there is also no moral duty to explore space.\n\nBut I would also argue that it is right to explore space, and that it is good to explore space.\n\nThis is the same distinction that I have made in the case of eating meat.\n\nComment: Exploration of space is not a moral obligation.

They are asking about whether humans should explore space or solve earth's problems first. If there were no problems on earth, there would be no need for space exploration because we have all the resources we need.\n\nComment: @JonathanReez I just updated the answer to address that.\n\nComment: I think the question is asking if we should focus on space exploration or solve earth's problems first. You're answer is that we should focus on earth's problems first, then solve space exploration.\n\nComment: @JonathanReez I just updated the answer again to address that.\n\nComment: I think that you're misunderstanding the question.

It needs to be reworded to make it clear that it's asking for an approximate average.\n\nThe way I would reword it is to ask for the \\strong{average number of blinks during a human lifetime}.  We can't actually count the number of blinks in a human lifetime, as that would require an infinite amount of time, but we can get a reasonable estimate by assuming that we blink about the same number of times every day.\n\nOne way to estimate this is to assume that on average, we blink about once every 10 minutes (the time between \"blink\" and \"blink\" is not consistent and may include a longer period of \"non-blink\").  So for a 24-hour day, we'll blink 144 times.  Now, let's assume that we're awake for 16 hours a day, and sleeping for 8 hours a day, so we'll blink twice as often while awake as while asleep (the actual ratio will depend on the individual).\n\nSo, for an 80-year lifetime, we'll blink 2.5 billion times while awake and 1.25 billion times while asleep, so the total number of blinks is 3.75 billion.\n\nThis is an \\strong{approximate} average, because there are many variables which affect the number of blinks in a lifetime, including how often the individual blinks, how long they stay awake, how long they stay asleep, and so on.\n\nComment: There are 60 seconds in a minute, so this is 1,056,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 48 seconds in a minute, so this is 1,056,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 16 seconds in a minute, so this is 1,808,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 24 seconds in a minute, so this is 1,808,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 60 seconds in a minute, so this is 1,808,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 365 days in a year, so this is 1,808,000,000 blinks per year.\n\nComment: There are 24 hours in a day, so this is 1,808,000,000 blinks", "I have a number of guesses, but I'm not sure how to estimate the number of blinks in a lifetime.

This means that you blink 60 times per minute, 3600 times per hour, and 86400 times per day.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so over a year you blink 30,368,000 times.\n\nNow, let's factor in the average life span of a human, which is about 70 years. So over your lifetime you blink 2,125,960,000 times.\n\nSo the average human blinks 15,494,000 times in an average lifetime.\n\nComment: I would assume your answer is correct, but I don't quite understand how you arrived at it.\n\nComment: @Morgan I used the assumption that the average human blinks at a rate of 10 blinks per minute, and factoring in the average life span of a human, which is about 70 years.\n\nComment: @Morgan I've edited my post to give you a more detailed explanation.\n\nAnswer: The answer is 15,494,000.\n\nIn this case we use the same method as in the [question 59696](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/59696/the-number-of-blinks-in-a-lifetime).\n\nWe assume that the average human blinks at a rate of 10 blinks per minute. This means that you blink 60 times per minute, 3600 times per hour, and 86400 times per day.\n\nThere are 365 days in a year, so over a year you blink 30,368,000 times.\n\nNow, let's factor in the average life span of a human, which is about", "684,000,000 times.\n\n\\strong{How I got it}\n\n60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 365 days in a year, 70 years in an average human life.\n\nAnswer: It is not easy to estimate an answer, because you have several unknowns. In one experiment a few years back, an average of 10 blinks per minute was found. In another experiment, the average was about 13 blinks in a minute. But these were just one-time observations, and it has been shown that with practice you can adjust your blinking rate.\n\nBut I'll try to answer your question as best I can. The biggest unknown is how long a human lives. The average life expectancy in the United States is about 78 years. Assuming that you blink about 10 times per minute, you would blink 10 times per minute times 60 seconds per minute times 60 minutes per hour times 24 hours per day times 365 days per year times 78 years.\n\nThat comes out to be 3,117,400,000 blinks. If you blink 10 times per minute, you blink about 200 times per hour. That means you blink about 5 times in 1 second. So over the course of 78 years, you blink 5 times in 1 second times 60 seconds in a minute times 60 minutes in an hour times 24 hours per day times 365 days per year times 78 years.\n\nThat comes out to 7,519,750,000 seconds. Now, you would blink 200 times in each second, so you blink 1,503,950,000,000 times over the course of 78 years.\n\nComment: This is quite an interesting answer, but that is the trouble with statistics. Someone could blink 10 times a minute for 3 seconds, and another could blink 10 times a minute for 60 seconds. That would make a difference of 59,760 blinks per minute."]}

The question asks about the number of messages sent *in a minute*.\n\nAnswer: You can start by calculating the number of SMS sent per second, and then multiply it by 60 to get those sent per minute.\n\nAnswer: Here are some estimates from 2011:\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-many-text-messages-are-sent-every-day-2010-11?op=1", "Here's what I would do:\n\nYou can start with the number of people in the world. Since we cannot know the exact number, I would assume that 60% of the worlds population has a cell phone. This gives you a total of 4 billion people.\n\nNext, you would have to know how many messages get sent by those people. I would again assume that 60% of them send at least one message per day. This gives you a total of 2.4 billion messages.\n\nThe last step is to figure out how many of those messages get sent per minute. You could start out by assuming that each person sends 100 messages per day.

This gives you 48,000 messages per minute.\n\nAll in all I would say that 48,000 messages get sent globally per minute.\n\nAnswer: The first step is to estimate the number of cell phones in the world, which is 4.6 billion.\n\nThe next step is to determine how many people have a cell phone. 70% of the world has a cell phone, so the number of people is 3.22 billion.\n\nThe last step is to estimate the number of text messages sent per person per day. 70% of people send at least one text per day, so that number is 2.25 billion.\n\nThen we need to estimate the number of texts sent per hour. If we assume that each person sends one text per hour on average, we get 56.16 million texts per hour.\n\nFinally, we need to estimate the number of texts sent per minute.

You only need the standard deviation of the number of messages sent. The value of this is the standard deviation of the number of messages sent per minute.\n\nComment: Okay, thank you for your help.\n\nAnswer: I am new to estimating as well and have also been tasked with this question.\n\nI found estimating the number of messages sent in a minute to be much more difficult than estimating the number of messages sent globally in a minute.\n\nI have found that the total number of messages sent globally per minute has been relatively consistent over time, but the number of messages sent has fluctuated over time.\n\nTherefore, I have decided to find the mean number of messages sent over the past decade and then use the standard deviation to estimate how many messages are sent in a minute.

The most plausible answer is probably that they would have spread across the Americas, as Native Americans did, and either met the Europeans at some point, or never met them at all.\n\nIn either case, there's a chance that they would have had an impact on the development of the Europeans. For instance, they might have brought the smallpox to Europe even earlier than it was brought by Columbus, or they might have brought the potato, and thus enabled Europe to grow enough food to support a large population.\n\nIt's also possible that they would have wiped out the Europeans in a short amount of time, either by disease or warfare.

One way to address it is to consider the technology of the Native Americans and then compare it to that of the Europeans. While the Europeans had a technological advantage, the Native Americans had a number of advantages that could have been useful in the New World. For example, the Native Americans had a better understanding of the environment and how to use it to their advantage. They also had a better understanding of the diseases that were prevalent in the New World and how to avoid them. Finally, the Native Americans were better at adapting to new conditions and environments.\n\nSo, what would have happened if the Native Americans had been the first to cross the Atlantic? It's difficult to say for sure, but it's likely that they would have had a significant impact on the development of the Americas.

{"prompt": "Suppose that Alan Turing and the folks at Bletchly Park were not able to break the Enigma ciphers. How would this have affected the Second World War?", "response_list": ["This is an excellent question.  The short answer is that it would have been a disaster for the Allies.  The longer answer is the content of this answer.\n\nThe Enigma machine was a portable cipher that allowed the Germans to send messages encrypted in such a way that the Allies could not easily decode them.  The British had a few of these machines that they had captured and they were working on a way to break the code.\n\nA code is just a way of translating a message from one language to another.  So a cipher is just a code, but the key is to have a cipher that the enemy cannot easily break.  Enigma had a key that changed each day.  They also had a way to send a message that was not just a normal text, but one that was also a code.  So the Germans would send an encrypted message that was itself a code.  The Enigma machine allowed this to be done by adding in some random numbers to the code.\n\nThe Enigma machine had a 26-letter, 10-number typewriter keyboard.  Each letter and number had a corresponding rotor.  The rotor was a disc with 26 contact points on it, one for each letter of the alphabet and one for each number.  Each contact point was connected to a second contact point with a wire.  To pick a letter or a number, the rotor was spun so that the contact point that was on top when the button was pressed was connected to the contact point of the letter or number you wanted.  This contact point was then connected to the contact point of the letter or number you want, sending that letter or number to print.\n\nTo make things more complicated, the Germans would change the rotors every day, and there were three rotors that could be used.  The Germans would also change the wiring every day, so that the wiring for one day is not the same as the wiring for the next.\n\nBreaking the Enigma code was no easy feat.  The British had a team of mathematicians and engineers who tried to break the code.  The code breakers were able to make some progress on the code, but the code breakers were not able to break the code quickly.  There were several people who were involved in trying to break the code.  Alan Turing (with the assistance of Peter Twinn) was able to come up with a way to greatly reduce the amount of time needed to break the code.  The code breakers did not realize that the Germans had a way to send a message that was also a code, so they did not try to decode the messages that were not just a normal text, but one that was also a code.  The code breakers would also need to decode the code and the message.  So they had to come up with a way to decode each part of the message.  This was not an easy feat.\n\nIn the end, the code breakers were able to break the Enigma code and they were able to break the code that was a message that was also a code.  The code breakers were able to break the code in a few months.\n\nThe code breakers were able to break the code because they were able to come up with a way to break the code.

I think most of their communications were sent by radio.\n\nComment: @Kenny:  The Germans were not able to communicate with the eastern front.  The Germans had very strict rules regarding radio communications and they were very good at following them.  The Germans communicated via the Enigma machines, and the Allies were able to break the code to the Enigma machine.  The Germans used the Enigma machines for the most important communications, such as those with the eastern front, and the Allies got most of their important information by breaking these codes.\n\nComment: @Ken", "Very much.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe Germans considered Enigma as unbreakable.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThat is because, in 1939, they were correct.

The Polish government-in-exile was doing so, and the British were receiving the decrypts.\n\nSo the British knew that the Germans were preparing an invasion of Norway, and that they planned to land in Norway on April 9th, 1940.

The Allies had 450 aircraft, while the Germans had 2500. The Germans had 300 tanks, while the Allies had 120.\n\nThe Germans were prepared for war, and the Allies were not. By the end of the day, the Norwegian government surrendered to the Germans.\n\nHad the Allies known the German plans, they could have made much better preparations for war, and may have been able to win the battle.\n\nComment: I thought it was 200,000 Germans vs. 140,000 Allies. And the real turning point was the Allies' inability to land at Narvik, and their inability to hold their ground there against the Germans.\n\nComment: @PeteL.Clark: I've made an edit.

The Nazis were forced to retreat and leave the Eastern Front.\n\nIf the Nazis had won the war, then they would have had to do the same thing with the US.  However, the US is a much larger country than the Soviet Union, so the Nazis would have probably had to pull more resources from elsewhere to win the American front.  The Nazis would have likely had to pull those resources from the Eastern Front.  If that happened, then the Nazis would have had to retreat from the Eastern Front.\n\nThis could have put the Nazis in a position where they would have had to re-fight the same battle in the East.  This would have put the Nazis in the worst possible scenario.  They would have had a huge battle in the East, and another huge battle in the West.

So we need phones, cellular, and so on. It's not easy to invent cell phones. It's not easy to make phone calls over long distances. It's not easy to make sure that the signal you're transmitting doesn't interfere with other signals that are transmitted at the same frequency, and vice-versa.\n\nThen we need to have a way to encode and transmit information. In a way, this is the hardest part, as it requires a lot of physics. But it's also the most abstract part. There is no way to predict what kind of encoding scheme will be invented.\n\nThen we need to have a way to store information. So we need to use magnetic tape to store information, or maybe we find a way to make optical storage (which was really invented in 1959).\n\nWe need to have computers. So we need to build them. This requires materials that are difficult to find.\n\nSo the answer to your question is, no, I don't think it's possible to have the internet 1000 years earlier.\n\nComment: I don't understand how your answer is different from the one I gave.\n\nComment: I think you didn't answer the question.

If we're using the modern definition of \"Internet\" (ie., a network of computers), it would probably require a lot of computers, which would require a lot of materials.\n\nFor example, 1980s tech required wafers of silicon. That required the development of silicon, which is the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust. But silicon itself is not conductive, so you need to add other material (like a doping element like phosphorous) to make it conductive.\n\nSo if we had more advanced materials, we could have built computers much, much earlier. The problem is, the development of those materials is dependent on a lot of other factors.\n\nFor example, the development of silicon required the development of a lot of other materials. You need to get silicon from the Earth's crust, which you can do with a smelting process. But to do that, you need electricity, which requires the development of wires, which requires the development of alloys, which requires the development of metallurgy.\n\nThat's just one example of a chain of events that are required to make the Internet.\n\nAnswer: The earliest version of the internet was called ARPANET. It was created in 1969 by people at DARPA. The development of computers was necessary to create the internet. Computers were not built until the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1951, a team of scientists created the first computer. It had 19,000 vacuum tubes. In 1969, ARPANET was created. Its main purpose was to share information among the different parts of the United States.\n\nComment: This does not provide an answer to the question.

Mercantile powers were still in their infancy and therefore were not able to muster the necessary manpower to defeat the Mongols.\n\nComment: And I'm wondering how Europe would have developed if the Mongols had never conquered the world.", "The question is not very clear. The Mongols did not conquer the world, but if they had, the world would look like Asia does today, with China dominating and Islam, Europe and the West in general weak.\n\nWithout the Mongol conquests, China would have been more likely to stay Confucian/Taoist and not become the Buddhist and Christian nation that it did.\n\nComment: The question is not very clear. The Mongols did not conquer the world, but if they had, the world would look like Asia does today, with China dominating and Islam, Europe and the West in general weak.\n\nComment: I was referring to the world in the 13th century before the Mongol conquest.\n\nComment: @Jason - well, that is a different question.\n\nComment: If the world was different in the 13th century, then it would not be the world in the 13th century.  Maybe the question is how would the world be different if the Mongols had never happened?

It is asking what would the world be like if the Mongols had never existed.\n\nComment: @JohnSkeet: I think he did, but I can't see any way to parse the question that way.  I can't get \"what if the Mongols never existed\" out of \"how would the world be different if the Mongol conquest never happened\".\n\nComment: @JohnH: It seems quite clear to me - \"What would the world be like if the Mongol conquest did not happen?\" and therefore \"If the Mongol conquest didn't happen, what would the world be like?\"\n\nComment: @JohnSkeet: The question asks \"How would the world be different if the Mongol conquest during the 13th Century never happened?\".  I can't see any way that the answer can be \"what if the Mongols never existed\".  You can see that the 13th century did happen, because here we all are.  So the question has to be about what happened in the 13th century.\n\nComment: @JohnH: It's a very poorly-phrased question, but I think it's clear enough.\n\nComment: @JohnH: It could be that the OP was referring to the 13th century and forgot to add \"during\"...\n\nComment: @JohnSkeet: I think it's a very badly-phrased question, and not clear in the slightest.

It was huge and spread over three continents, and was the largest contiguous empire until the British Empire.\n\nThe Mongol Empire was one of the most multicultural and multiethnic empires of all time. It was united by a common language, an open and relatively tolerant policy towards other religions, and the common rule of law. The Mongols ruled over China, Korea, Japan, Persia, India, Anatolia, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia.\n\nThe Mongols were one of the most important military forces in history. Their military organization, tactics, and strategy were highly effective.

There would be no Hungary, no Poland, no Croatia, no Bohemia, no Lithuania, and no Russia.  The Ottomans would not exist, and the Byzantines would be a lot closer to the Western Europeans.

Instead, it helped push the Rus' eastward, where they formed the nucleus of Muscovy.\n\nComment: @TerryLoring The Mongols didn't exist to Russia until the 13th century.\n\nComment: @TerryLoring The Russian lands were not part of the Mongol empire.  It was ruled indirectly by the Golden Horde.  The Mongol empire wasn't as centralized as most people think, and the Mongols weren't a single people.", "Without the Mongol conquest, we would not have the modern world.\n\nWhy? Because without the Mongol conquest, the world would still be centered around the Mediterranean, and would not have developed the technology to cross the Atlantic.\n\nThe Mongol conquest connected the western world with the eastern world.  It connected Europe to Eurasia.  It opened up a huge amount of trade, and trade brings advancement.\n\nComment: So, you're saying that the Mongol conquest led to the Industrial Revolution?\n\nComment: @Greg: You asked what would have happened if the Mongol conquest never happened.  I answered that.\n\nComment: I'm not sure I agree with this, the Byzantines had a fairly healthy trade with the east and had been in contact with the Muslim world since the 7th century, even the Crusades helped bring the west and east closer together. There were all sorts of trading routes that bypassed the Mongols. The Mongol empire itself was already well established when the first European explorers crossed the Atlantic.\n\nComment: @Jim: The Byzantines had a trade with the east, but it was quite limited and was not enough to spread ideas like gunpowder.  The Muslim world was mostly cut off from the west. The Crusades helped, but they did not last very long.  The Mongol empire was spreading at the time the first Europeans crossed the Atlantic, but it was already spread over a huge area.  The Mongols had been conquering and uniting the world for centuries already.\n\nComment: @Jim: Also, I never said that the Mongol conquest led to the Industrial Revolution.  I said that without the Mongol conquest, there would be no Industrial Revolution, because it would be impossible to cross the Atlantic.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: I was thinking about the same answer. I'll probably expand on it if I find time.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: If we were still in the Medieval period, it is likely that the Atlantic would have been explored by Europeans.  The first person to cross the Atlantic did not have to use gunpowder, and the Mongols never conquered the Americas.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: Yes, the Mongol conquests made it easier to conquer the Americas, but that does not mean that they made it necessary.  The Mongol conquests just made it easier.  In the case of the Americas, the Europeans were already advancing in technology, so it was only a matter of time before they conquered the Americas.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: I think I'll post an answer.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: I think I'll just write an essay.\n\nComment: This answer is a bit simplistic. Just because the Mongols were dominant on one side of Eurasia doesn't mean that another, different, culture wouldn't have developed the same trade connections. It's not so much that the Mongols were necessary for the trade connections as that they were the ones to take advantage of the trade opportunities.\n\nComment: @Mark: I never said that the Mongols were necessary for the trade connections.  I said that without the Mongol conquests, there would be no trade connections.  The Mongols were the ones to take advantage of the trade opportunities, but the opportunities existed because of the Mongols.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: The Mongol conquests opened up trade routes between the east and the west.  It made it possible to cross the Atlantic.  Europeans were still in the medieval period, so they would not have been able to cross the Atlantic without gunpowder.  So, without the Mongol conquests, there would be no trade between the east and the west, and without that trade, it would be impossible to cross the Atlantic.  So, without the Mongol conquests, there would be no Industrial Revolution.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: Also, you are correct that the Mongols were not necessary for the trade connections.  However, the Mongols are what actually made the trade connections.  So, even if another culture would have made the trade connections, they would not have done so without the Mongols.\n\nComment: @T.E.D.: I think I'll just write a book.\n\nComment: @Mark: The Mongol culture was not the *only* culture that could have taken"]}

So, yes, he would have discovered evolution.\n\nComment: @JeffE: I just realized you have a different question in mind. You're asking if Newton would have discovered evolution if he had been a biologist and hadn't worked out calculus and physics. I don't think so. To be a good biologist, you need to know a lot about biology. To be a good mathematician, you need to know a lot about math. A good mathematician can use math to model a lot of things, but not everything.\n\nComment: @JeffE: If Newton hadn't discovered calculus and physics, he wouldn't have been able to do a lot of the work that he did (I'm sure he would have done something else, but it wouldn't have been the same).

The first non-null element in the table is the second Fibonacci number. The number of non-null elements in the table is equal to the number of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWe can represent this as:\n\nnumber_of_fib_numbers = nth_fib_number\n\nSince you are asking for the nth Fibonacci number, we can also represent this as:\n\nnth_fib_number = number_of_fib_numbers\n\nNow, what we want to do is fill in the table.\n\nThe first non-null element in the table is the second Fibonacci number. Therefore:\n\nnth_fib_number = 2\n\nNow, we know that the second Fibonacci number is equal to the first Fibonacci number plus the previous Fibonacci number. Therefore, we can fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 2\n\nprevious_fib_number = 1\n\nFinally, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 3\n\nprevious_fib_number = 2\n\nThe next step will be to add 1 to the previous number and the next number and update the current and previous numbers.\n\nNow, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nprevious_fib_number = 3\n\nNow, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 5\n\nprevious_fib_number = 4\n\nNow, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 8\n\nprevious_fib_number = 7\n\nNow, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 13\n\nprevious_fib_number = 12\n\nNow, we want to fill in the table to be:\n\nnth_fib_number = 21\n\nprevious_fib_number = 20\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe number of non-null elements in the table is equal to the Fibonacci number you are trying to find.\n\nThe number of non-null elements in the table is equal to the number of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nAnswer: Here's my solution.\n\n\\begin{code}\npublic class Fibonacci {\n    // array to store the values\n    int[] a;\n\n    // array of length = 1\n    int[] b;\n\n    // length of the array\n    int n;\n\n    // initialize the array\n    void initialize(int n) {\n        this.n ="]}

This solved my problem, and now I know what is going on when I was working with lists.", "When you assign a variable to a value, Python does not make a copy of the value. Instead, it makes a reference to the value. This means that any change to the value will be reflected in the variable, and vice versa. This is why you are seeing your changes to `new_list` reflected in `my_list`: `new_list` points to the same object in memory as `my_list`, so any change to one will affect the other.\n\nTo create a copy of a list, you can use the [`copy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) module:\n\n\\begin{code}\nfrom copy import copy\n\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nnew_list = copy(my_list)\n\nnew_list[0] = 0\nprint(my_list)\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will print `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\nComment: I see, so is it possible to do something similar to the above code, but in a way that a new variable is created, but without the changes of one being reflected in the other?\n\nComment: @JoeSchmoe Yes, you can use the `copy` module to create a mutable copy of a list, which will be a separate object from the original list.\n\nAnswer: When you do\n\n\\begin{code}\nnew_list = my_list\n\\end{code}\n\nyou are just giving the variable `new_list` the same reference to the object my_list. This means that even though you are referencing two different variables, they point to the same object. You can see this with the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nnew_list = my_list\nprint(new_list is my_list)\nmy_list.append(4)\nprint(new_list)\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will print `True` and then `[[1, 2, 3, 4]]`. Notice how the second list has changed even though you did not change it.\n\nYou can create a new object using the `copy` module. For example:\n\n\\begin{code}\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nnew_list = copy(my_list)\nprint(new_list is my_list)\nmy_list.append(4)\nprint(new_list)\n\\end{code}\n\nThis will print `False` and then `[[1, 2, 3]]`.

If you call a method that returns a list, then it's a list.\n\nIt's also very important to know the difference between a list and a tuple.\n\nThe fact that you can change the value of a variable is a pythonism, not a bug.  If you want an immutable structure, then you want a tuple.\n\nAnswer: In addition to the other answers:\n\nThe `[:]` does not clone the list, it creates a shallow copy of the list.\n\nYou can also create a deep copy with `copy.deepcopy` from the `copy` module.\n\nAnswer: This is a \\strong{very} important question, and I think the answers above miss the point a bit.\n\nWhat you are seeing is a \\strong{copy-on-write} effect.  When you do `new_list = my_list`, you are creating a new reference to the same object.  If you change the contents of `new_list` (e.g. `new_list.append(...)`), then the object that both `my_list` and `new_list` reference get a new version.  If you change the contents of `my_list`, then `new_list` will get a new version, too.\n\nIn Python, everything is an object, and all objects have \\em{references} to them.  A list is a type of object, and `new_list` is a reference to the list object that `my_list` references.  If you change the contents of `my_list`, the object that both `my_list` and `new_list` reference gets a new version.  The changes \\em{are} reflected in the object.  If you had instead done `new_list = my_list[:]`, then you would have a new reference to the old object, and no changes to the object would affect it.  That's the difference between \\em{shallow copy} and \\em{deep copy}.\n\nThe `[:]` method is a shallow copy.  It only creates a new reference to the object, not a new object with the same contents.  The other answers are correct about what to do if you want a deep copy, but they didn't tell you about what is happening.\n\nAnswer: You can do the following to copy the list.\n\n\\begin{code}\n>>> my_list = [\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"]\n>>> new_list = [x for x in my_list]\n>>> new_list\n['one', 'two', 'three']\n>>> my_list[1] = \"four\"\n>>> new_list\n['one', 'four', 'three']\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: This is not an answer.

I agree with your second comment. That's why I said \"indirect proof\".\n\nComment: @ShreevatsaR: I'm just saying that \"indirect proof\" is a synonym for \"proof by contradiction,\" not for \"proof that doesn't involve direct proof.\"  So if you're going to use \"indirect proof\" as a synonym for \"proof by contradiction,\" you might as well just say \"proof by contradiction.\"  If you're going to use it as a synonym for \"proof that doesn't involve direct proof,\" you might as well just say \"proof that doesn't involve direct proof.\"  The ambiguity is not worth the extra syllable in either case.\n\nComment: @ShreevatsaR: Actually, I'm not sure \"indirect proof\" is even a useful term.  It's not clear to me that there are any proofs that don't involve direct proof.  For example, if you prove that $a = b$ by showing that $a = c$ and $c = b$, you've used a direct proof (i.e., you've shown that $a = b$).  The proof that $a = b$ implies $c = d$ is also a direct proof (i.e., it's a proof of $c = d$ that doesn't involve $a$ and $b$).  It's not clear to me that there's any useful distinction between proofs that don't use \"direct proof\" and proofs that don't use \"indirect proof.\"\n\nComment: @R.Burton: I agree that there are no proofs that don't involve direct proof, but I still think \"indirect proof\" is a useful term.

The error happens when you try to map the words and phrases to an interpretation.  When you do that, you will find a mismatch.  The same error happens in natural language processing.\n\nThis is a very common error in programming.  For example, you might try to access the 100th element of a list, but the list only has 99 elements.  You get an error because the list doesn't contain an element with the index 100.\n\nIn this case, you have created a list of fruits, but you try to access an index which doesn't exist.

{"prompt": "Write an essay discussing the importance of communication in a relationship.", "response_list": ["Communication is vital to all relationships. It allows us to express ourselves, share our thoughts and feelings, and connect with others on a deep level. Good communication skills are essential for building strong, healthy relationships.\n\nWithout effective communication, relationships can quickly become strained or even break down. When we don't communicate well with others, it can lead to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and frustration.\n\nGood communication requires both effective listening and expressing ourselves clearly. It's important to be open and honest with our partners, and to listen actively to what they have to say. This means being present in the moment and really paying attention to what is being said, rather than just waiting for our turn to speak.\n\nCommunication is also important in resolving conflicts. When disagreements arise, it's important to talk about them openly and honestly, rather than avoiding the issue or letting it fester. Good communication skills can help us to understand each other's perspectives and find a mutually satisfying solution.\n\nOverall, communication is crucial in building and maintaining strong, healthy relationships. By developing good communication skills, we can deepen our connections with others and create a more fulfilling and rewarding life.\n\nComment: While this is a good answer, it is not an essay. Please edit or delete it.", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWrite an essay discussing the importance of communication in a relationship.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI think that communication is the basis of any relationship. If two people cannot communicate, they will not be able to relate in any way, and the relationship will be a failure. Communication is an essential element in the relationships between people, whether it be a friendship, a marriage or a family. The lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts and even the end of a relationship.\n\nIn the first place, communication is necessary in a relationship to establish an understanding between the two parties. Without communication, it is impossible to understand the other person's point of view. Moreover, it is not possible to get to know the other person and to establish a relationship based on mutual understanding and respect.\n\nMoreover, communication is essential to resolve conflicts that may arise between the two parties in a relationship. Conflicts can arise from different points of view, different expectations or different ways of relating to each other. However, if there is no communication, it is impossible to resolve the conflicts and the relationship will be in danger of breaking down.\n\nFinally, communication is essential in a relationship to maintain the relationship over time. Without communication, it is impossible to keep the relationship alive and to maintain the feelings of love and affection between the two parties. The lack of communication can lead to apathy, indifference, and even the death of the relationship.\n\nIn short, communication is the basis of any relationship. Without communication, it is impossible to establish an understanding between the two parties, to resolve conflicts and to maintain the relationship over time. That is why communication is so important in a relationship.\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer.\n\nComment: You're welcome.\n\nAnswer: \"Communication is the process of transmitting information and common understanding from one person to another.\"\n\nThis is a quote from google on communication, it goes on to say  \"While communication is a process, it is also a skill that needs to be learned and can be improved with practice and training.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure what \"Write an essay discussing the importance of communication in a relationship\" means, but if I were to write an essay on it, I would start by asking \"What is the difference between talking and communicating?\" and then \"What is the difference between listening and hearing?\"\n\nWhile these terms may seem like they mean the same thing, they don't.\n\nCommunication is the key to any relationship, whether it's a friendship, a romantic relationship, or a relationship between a parent and child. Without communication, it's difficult to build trust, to understand each other, and to work together toward common goals.\n\n\\strong{Talking} is using words to express ideas, feelings, or thoughts. It can be done in any language, including sign language.\n\n\\strong{Communicating} is using words and nonverbal cues (such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice) to exchange information and ideas.\n\n\\strong{Listening} is paying attention to what someone is saying and trying to understand their point of view.\n\n\\strong{Hearing} is simply receiving sound waves with your ears.\n\nYou can hear someone talking, but not necessarily understand what they're saying.\n\nWhile communication is the key to any relationship, it's also important to remember that communication takes practice. We all communicate differently, and it takes time to learn how to communicate effectively with others.\n\nIf you're having trouble communicating with someone, try to remember that communication is a skill that can be improved with practice and training.\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer.\n\nAnswer: Communication is a very important part of any relationship. It is through communication that we share our thoughts, feelings, and ideas with others. It is also through communication that we learn about others and build relationships.\n\nWithout communication we would be lost in a sea of emotions and thoughts with no way to share them. We would also have no way to learn about others or build relationships.\n\nCommunication is not only important in relationships between people, but also in relationships between animals, plants, and even objects. Without communication we would be unable to understand or interact with the world around us.\n\nAnswer: Communication is a very important aspect of any relationship.

This means using active listening skills, avoiding blaming and criticizing, and being willing to compromise and find solutions that work for both parties. Effective communication builds a stronger connection between the partners and helps to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications that can lead to resentment and distance.\n\nWhen communication breaks down in a relationship, it can lead to a variety of issues, including feelings of isolation, hurt, and confusion.

If so, then you are correct that you are in trouble.  (Unless it is the first day of class.  In that case, you are in less trouble, but still in trouble.)  The question is, how much trouble?\n\nIf you are in the 99th percentile and get a 40, then you are in much less trouble than if you are in the 80th percentile and get a 40.\n\nBut you don't know what percentile you are in.  In the first case, you might be in the 99th percentile, but you might be in the 98th percentile.  And in the second case, you might be in the 80th percentile, but you might be in the 79th percentile.  The only information you have is that you did better than 90% of the students and worse than 10% of the students.  You don't know the distribution of the other 90%.  If you are in the top 10%, then you are in much less trouble than if you are in the middle 90%.\n\nSo you need to be more specific about the distribution of scores.  Did you get a C on a C+ curve?  Did you get a C on an A+ curve?  Also, what is the relative importance of this course for your academic future?  Is it a major requirement?  That might make you more desperate than if it is an elective.  If you are in trouble, you should see your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your concerns.  You should also try to determine the grading curve and the distribution of exam scores.\n\nComment: I got a 40% in an exam , out of 100% .\n\nComment: @Dinesh: I've edited my answer to address this.  You need to be more specific than just saying \"I got a 40%.\"  You need to know what percentile you are in.  Also, you should see your instructor as soon as possible to discuss your concerns.  You should also try to determine the grading curve and the distribution of exam scores.\n\nComment: I hope that was not too harsh.\n\nComment: @Dinesh: It was not too harsh.

Include details of other opportunities to thank them for, but also let them know you are looking to advance your career and that the timing is right.  Thank them for what you learned and what they mean to you, but be honest about what you're looking for.\n\nIt's not a bad idea to be as polite and cordial as you can.  Include details about how much you appreciate working for them, but also don't hesitate to let them know that you've landed on your feet.\n\nIt's always a good idea to give as much notice as possible, and it shows that you are professional.  Even if you get a better offer before the time you planned to leave, the fact that you gave notice is something they will remember.  In the future, if you find yourself in a position to hire someone, you can be assured that you'll be remembering that when you make your decision.\n\nComment: \"Include details of other opportunities to thank them for\".  If you are leaving because you want to advance your career, and you received a better offer, wouldn't you want to keep that information to yourself?\n\nComment: I'd think that it's a good idea to let them know that you are advancing your career.  If you don't, you'll just look like you're leaving to find a better job.  If they find out that you got a better opportunity, you can only hope that they'll be happy for you, otherwise you might have to deal with a bad reference.\n\nComment: I don't think it's a good idea to tell your current employer that you've gotten a better offer.  If you do, they may try to counter-offer, which you may not want to accept, but might feel compelled to.  If you're leaving because you've gotten a better offer, then that's the reason you're leaving.  If you tell your current employer that, they're unlikely to be happy for you.  They'd rather you stay, and they might take it personally if you leave for a better offer.\n\nComment: If you had written anything about that in your question, I would have answered it differently.  Even if you're leaving on good terms, I wouldn't be comfortable telling your employer that you have another job offer.  It's not a good idea to burn bridges, and it's not a good idea to let your employer know that you've gotten an offer from somebody else.\n\nComment: I was under the impression that it was in poor taste to tell your employer that you have another job offer, if you are leaving on good terms and wish to leave gracefully.

In this episode, we will be discussing the influence of streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora on the music industry.\n\nI'm your host, Sarah, and I'm joined by my co-host, John. John, what are your thoughts on this topic?\n\nJohn: Great question, Sarah. I think it's no surprise that streaming platforms have had a huge impact on the music industry. In fact, streaming made up the majority of music industry revenue in 2019, and it shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nSarah: That's true, John. Streaming has changed the way we consume music and has opened up opportunities for musicians and record labels alike. Can you tell us a little more about how streaming has changed the music industry?\n\nJohn: Sure. One of the biggest changes is that streaming has made it easier for musicians to reach a larger audience. In the past, musicians had to rely on traditional radio play or word of mouth to gain exposure. With streaming, musicians can reach a global audience with just a few clicks.\n\nSarah: That's true, and it's also made it easier for independent musicians to compete with major labels. Streaming platforms have opened up opportunities for independent musicians to get their music out there, and many have found success through streaming.\n\nJohn: That's right. Streaming has also changed the way we discover new music. In the past, we had to rely on friends or DJs to introduce us to new artists. With streaming, we can simply search for new music and discover artists that we might not have heard of otherwise.\n\nSarah: Absolutely. And that's not all. Streaming has also changed the way we listen to music. In the past, we would have to buy entire albums or CDs to hear our favorite songs. With streaming, we can simply listen to individual songs or create custom playlists.\n\nJohn: That's right, and it's also changed the way we interact with music. With streaming, we can see what our friends are listening to and discover new artists through that way.

As long as you know that a `Geography` can be returned, I don't see any reason why you would need to know the specific type.  In fact, why would you ever need to know the specific type?  The point is to use a method that returns a `Geography` and then cast it to a `Geography`.\n\nComment: The question is tagged `sql-server-2008` and this solution worked for me in 2008. The problem is that there are 5 types of geometry and the API has different types of methods for each of them. I can see why you would need to know the specific type - to use the right method.\n\nComment: @MartinSmith - Yes, that's correct.  I'm not sure what your point is.  Both of my examples work in 2008.\n\nComment: It's true that both of your examples worked in 2008. That's because you are using the `Geography` type. In 2008 there were also 4 other types (Point, LineString, Polygon and MultiPoint) that have different methods. The point is that you cannot use the above code to determine the type of the returned object. You can call `STGeomFromText()` with a string which is a `Polygon` and get a `Geography` object back.\n\nComment: @MartinSmith - I think you are misunderstanding me.  I am not saying that this method will return the exact type you want.  I am saying that this method will return a `Geography` type and that's all you need.  If you want to know the specific type, you can use the `STIs` methods.

Do you really believe that the medical establishment is being held back on COVID-19 treatments so as not to offend the radical left?  That is, are you claiming that the left is forcing doctors to suppress treatments for a disease that is killing people?\n\nI don't know.  I don't think that there is any left wing conspiracy or agenda against medical progress.  I think that there are people who don't like masks, who don't like vaccines, who don't like social distancing, who don't like lockdowns, who don't like the fact that the science changes as we learn more about the virus, and who just generally like to complain about things.\n\nI think that there are people who get their information from sources whose only goal is to make money.

He's been brainwashed and he can't leave, or he could leave but then he'd be killed.\n\nFourth, write about how you would feel if you were a member of the Islamic State.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to ask people who are experts on the Islamic State for advice.\n\nAnswer: Here are some general pointers:\n\n\\section{Do your research}\n\nThere's a lot of information available about ISIS. Read up on what they believe, how they operate, what their goals are, and how they go about meeting those goals.\n\n\\section{Don't oversimplify}\n\nISIS is a complex, multifaceted organization. It's not just a group of religious fanatics. They have a variety of motivations for what they do, and they've been very successful at attracting and retaining members.\n\n\\section{Avoid stereotypes}\n\nDon't assume that all ISIS members are evil, or that all Muslims support ISIS.\n\n\\section{Be honest}\n\nISIS is a real organization, with real members. While you may want to write a sympathetic story from an ISIS member's perspective, it's important to remember that not all ISIS members are sympathetic.\n\n\\section{Be respectful}\n\nISIS is a sensitive topic, and there are many people who have been affected by their actions. Be sure to think about how your story might impact them before you write it.\n\n\\section{Don't glorify violence}\n\nISIS is a violent organization, and their actions have caused a great deal of suffering. Avoid glorifying or romanticizing violence in your story.\n\n\\section{Offer hope}\n\nEven though ISIS is a difficult topic to write about, you can still offer hope and inspiration in your story. Consider what people can do to resist ISIS and fight for a better future.\n\nAnswer: I think you should write about the perspective of an ISIS member who is trying to leave the organization. Maybe they've had a change of heart, or they're no longer willing to carry out the violence and brutality that the group demands. Write about their struggle to leave, and the consequences they might face if they're caught trying to escape.\n\nAnother option could be to write about an ISIS member who is conflicted about their beliefs and actions. Maybe they're starting to question the group's ideology, or they're struggling with the guilt of what they've done. Write about their internal battle, and how they try to cope with the conflict within themselves.\n\nFinally, you could write about an ISIS member who is caught in the middle of a conflict between the group and another faction. Write about how they try to navigate the dangerous and complex situation, and the choices they make in the process.\n\nRegardless of what you decide to write about, I think it's important to remember that ISIS is a complex and multifaceted organization. It's not just a group of religious fanatics, but a collection of individuals with their own motivations, beliefs and perspectives.\n\nAnswer: I suggest that you look at the history of the organization and write about how the group came to be and what factors led to its rise to power. You could also write about the internal dynamics of the group, such as how it is organized and how decisions are made.\n\nAnother approach could be to write about the impact that the group has had on the people and places it controls. You could write about the experiences of those who have been forced to live under the group's rule, as well as those who have been recruited or coerced into joining the group.\n\nFinally, you could write about the efforts to counter the group and what challenges this poses for those involved. You could write about the experiences of those who are working to counter the group, such as journalists, aid workers, and military personnel.\n\nOverall, it is important to remember that ISIS is a complex and multifaceted organization, and that there", "As stated in another answer, I'd say that you can't do this.\n\nHowever if you have a reason for doing so, I'd say that you should try to make your ISIS member as sympathetic as possible.

This would lead your ISIS member to take the child away from the other hostages and care for it while the hostage crisis is going on.\n\nAnother way would be to make your ISIS member to be religious, but not as extreme as the rest of the group.\n\nIn the end, though, I still don't think you can make the reader sympathetic with the ISIS member.\n\nComment: Or the child is an orphan with nowhere else to go and no one to care for them.

However, that can be extremely risky.\n\nTo make the most of your money, you'll need to know how to analyze the market.

When you invest in cryptocurrency, your money can either go up in value or down in value.

There are websites that promise to double your investment in cryptocurrency and there are people that promise to invest your money and double it for you.

It depends on a lot of factors such as your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.\n\nFor example, if you are looking to invest for the long term (10+ years), then cryptocurrency may not be the best option for you. However, if you are looking to invest for the short term (i.e., 1-2 years), then cryptocurrency may be a good option.\n\nIt is important to note that cryptocurrency is a very speculative asset class, and thus, it should only make up a small portion of your overall investment portfolio.\n\nAnswer: Investing in cryptocurrency is not a good idea unless you have a very high risk tolerance and are prepared to lose all of your money. The reason for this is that the market for cryptocurrency is highly volatile, and there is no guarantee that any given cryptocurrency will increase in value. Additionally, many cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything, so they are not a good store of value.\n\nComment: It should be noted that cryptocurrency is a very speculative asset class.

If you're looking for something to speculate on, then it might be a good investment.", "\\section{It really depends on what kind of investment you want}\n\n\\em{It's important to remember that \"investment\" in the cryptocurrency world is quite different to investing in the traditional sense. In cryptocurrencies, what you are really doing is speculating on the future price of a coin, rather than putting your money into something where you hope to see returns in the form of dividends, interest or capital growth.}\n\nCryptocurrencies, as a whole, are a very volatile market. Prices can fluctuate greatly from day to day, or even from hour to hour, and while this can be a great way to make a quick profit, it's important to remember that losing money quickly is also a possibility.\n\n\\section{A quick look at Bitcoin}\n\n\\em{Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency by far, and is often regarded as the \"gold standard\" of cryptocurrencies. It has a limited supply of coins (21 million), so in theory, the value of Bitcoin should increase over time. However, this is not necessarily the case, and the value of Bitcoin has fluctuated greatly over the past few years.}\n\n\\section{Now for the good news}\n\n\\em{Bitcoin was worth around $15,000 at the start of 2018, but its value has dropped to around $3,500 in recent weeks, due to the rise of other cryptocurrencies and negative press coverage. This means that if you had bought $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in December 2017, it would have dropped to around $5,000 by now, and a lot of people would be very unhappy with their returns. However, if you had sold $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in December 2017, you would have made a profit of around $7,000, not including any price fluctuations after that. So, on the whole, you would probably have made a profit.}\n\n\\section{But what about the future?}\n\n\\em{Well, there are two sides to this situation. If you had sold Bitcoin in December 2017, it's likely you would have made a profit, but you would have missed out on the potential for even larger gains in the future, as Bitcoin is only starting to recover now, and could easily reach $50,000 or more in the next few years. However, if you had bought Bitcoin in December 2017, you would have made a profit, but if the market continues to fall, it's possible you could lose a large amount of money.}\n\n\\section{So what should you do?}\n\n\\em{If you had bought Bitcoin in December 2017, it would be a good idea to sell it now, as you would have made a profit, and you will not be exposed to further price drops. However, it's important to remember that Bitcoin is still a very volatile market, and there is always a possibility that the price could fall even further, so it's not a guaranteed profit. If you are wanting to invest in Bitcoin for the long-term, it's still a good idea to buy now, as the price is still relatively low compared to its potential future value, and even if it falls further, it's likely to recover over time.}\n\n\\section{And what about other cryptocurrencies?}\n\n\\em{There are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there, and while some have great potential, most are highly speculative and have very low liquidity. You can find a list of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap on CoinMarketCap.com. The top 10 cryptocurrencies at the time of writing (July 2018) are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Cardano, IOTA, NEO, EOS, and Dash. Of these, the only one that is widely considered to be a safe investment is Bitcoin, as it is the most established and has the largest market cap. The others are all very speculative and are not recommended for beginners.}\n\n\\section{So what should you do?}\n\n\\em{If you want to invest in cryptocurrencies, it's important to do your own research and only invest what you can afford to lose. You", "It depends on your risk appetite.\n\nCryptocurrencies are very volatile, highly speculative instruments. They do not generate any cash flows, and their valuations are based on the market's expectation of future valuations.\n\nThere are a number of cryptocurrencies that exist and many more that will come into existence. The best cryptocurrency money can buy depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a coin where you can buy things with it, you should look at the top 100 coins by market capitalisation. If you're looking to make money, the top 500 coins by market capitalisation are probably a better place to start. If you're looking for a coin where the price will go up quickly, you should probably look at the top 1000 coins by market capitalisation. If you're looking for a coin where the price will go down quickly, you should probably look at the top 10,000 coins by market capitalisation.\n\nIn terms of risk, it's important to remember that there are a lot of risks involved in owning cryptocurrencies. You can lose all your money, you can lose all your money if you lose your private key (the key that allows you to spend your cryptocurrencies), you can lose all your money if you lose your private key and you lose your cryptocurrencies, you can lose all your money if you lose your private key and you lose your cryptocurrencies and you lose your cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn terms of returns, it's important to remember that there are a lot of returns to be made in cryptocurrencies. You can make money if you have a good idea and you have a lot of money, you can make money if you have a good idea and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money, you can make money if you have a good idea and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money, you can make money if you have a good idea and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money and you have a lot of money.\n\nComment: Your answer could be improved with additional supporting information.

However, it is important to remember that cryptocurrency is a risky investment. There is no guarantee that your investment will be successful.\n\nThere are a number of factors that you should consider before investing in cryptocurrency. First, you should make sure that you understand the basics of cryptocurrency. You should also consider the volatility of the market. Finally, you should decide how much money you are willing to invest.\n\nOnce you have considered these factors, you can begin to invest in cryptocurrency. There are a number of different ways to invest in cryptocurrency. You can purchase cryptocurrency directly from an exchange. You can also purchase cryptocurrency from a brokerage.\n\nFinally, you can also invest in cryptocurrency through a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These investments allow you to invest in a basket of cryptocurrencies.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nIs now a suitable time to invest in cryptocurrency?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nCryptocurrencies are a new asset class and as such they are volatile. If you are looking for investment advice, you should consult a financial advisor.\n\nYou can also consider investing in cryptocurrencies through a cryptocurrency exchange. There are a number of cryptocurrency exchanges that allow you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges include Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase.\n\nAnswer: Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are classified as a subset of digital currencies and are also classified as a subset of alternative currencies and virtual currencies.\n\nCryptocurrencies are a new form of currency that is not backed by any government or central bank."]}

I see people saying that robots will take jobs away from humans. But I also see people saying that robots will create more jobs for humans because they will make products and services cheaper and more affordable.\n\nPersonally, I think that robots will create more jobs for humans than they take away.\n\nAnswer: If you want to become a robot designer, you should check out [robotics.stackexchange.com](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/). They have a lot of questions and answers on how to design robots.\n\nAnswer: This question is very broad and there are a lot of things to consider. For example, what are you trying to design? A robot that picks up and moves objects? A robot that can do basic tasks like making a cup of coffee? There are also a lot of different types of robots, like industrial robots, service robots, and personal robots.\n\nAnother thing to consider is what you want the robot to do. For example, do you want it to do a task once, or do you want it to be able to do the task over and over again? Do you want it to be able to do the task with no supervision, or do you want it to be able to do the task with supervision?\n\nFinally, you need to think about the environment in which the robot will be operating. For example, will the robot be operating in a home, or in a factory? Will the robot be operating in a clean environment, or in a dirty environment?\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, you can start to think about the design of the robot. For example, what kind of materials should the robot be made out of? What kind of sensors should the robot have? What kind of actuators should the robot have?\n\nThis is a very complex question, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. However, I hope that this article has given you a starting point to help you design your own robot.", "I think it's a very exciting time for the labor market as robots and humans are learning how to work together.

My personal view is that, and this is a very, very controversial view, I think that AI will become so good that we will have to use it to take care of the basic tasks that we currently do as humans, so that we can focus on the more higher-level tasks, the more creative tasks. And that means there's going to be a massive dislocation. And there are already millions of jobs that are threatened by AI, and there are millions of jobs that could be threatened by AI.\n\nIn order for us to take care of this dislocation, we need to have a way of taking care of people that will lose their jobs. That means that we need to have a universal basic income, possibly a universal basic income that is implemented by the government, or maybe the government will just have to give people money. But I think it's very important that we start taking the threat of AI seriously and that we start thinking about the ways in which we can make our society more resilient to that kind of threat.\n\nAnd I hope that the government is doing that, but there's a lot of misinformation about this. There's a lot of people that don't understand what's going on and don't understand the threat, and there's a lot of people that don't want to understand the threat because they think it's going to cost them a lot of money. But I really think that we need to start taking this seriously.\n\nComment: What if the universal basic income is provided by the employers of robots? I think that a universal basic income is not only a way to deal with unemployment, but also a way to deal with the \"productivity paradox\" and increase the productivity of human workers.\n\nComment: @Kerem: I don't think that's the way it's going to happen. There are a lot of people who are afraid of AI and afraid of robots, and they're not going to want to invest in them. They're going to be afraid that they're going to take their jobs, and they're going to be afraid of the dislocation that's going to cause. So they're not going to want to invest in robots. And there are a lot of people who are not going to want to invest in robots, because they're going to be afraid that they're going to take their jobs, and they're going to be afraid of the dislocation that's going to cause.\n\nComment: @Kerem: And I think that the government is going to have to give people money, because the government is going to have to take care of the people who are going to lose their jobs.

{"prompt": "Is it ok to cheat on my bf since he cheated on me first?", "response_list": ["One thing you can do is make sure you don't have any unprotected sex with the guy.  It may be too late for that, and you may be okay, but you don't want to risk it.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer when it comes to cheating.  It's a personal decision.  But do consider what you're asking for.  If you get pregnant, you're going to have to tell the other guy.  You'll have to tell him whether you decided to keep the baby, and if you decide to have an abortion, you'll have to tell him that too.  He's going to raise the child with you.  You're going to have to figure out how to tell your boyfriend.  You're going to have to go to school knowing that you're pregnant and have a child on the way.\n\nIf you've decided you can't go through with the pregnancy, you're going to have to either move to another town or move in with your parents.  You're going to be in a very awkward position and it's not going to be easy.\n\nSo, while there's no real right or wrong answer, you should be aware of what you're getting yourself into.\n\nComment: I am 18 and I don't want to have kids at all. I am not ready for kids at all. I have done everything I can to avoid the subject with this new guy, but he keeps bringing it up. I don't want kids. He keeps saying he wants to be a dad and what if we get married....I don't want to get married, I just want to have fun and be single. I don't have to be in a relationship. I don't have to have sex. I am just done with him and I am tired of talking to him. He just keeps getting worse, and I just want to walk away.\n\nAnswer: If you have unprotected sex with him, you are at risk of contracting STDs that he may have. You can have an STD test done and be tested for pregnancy. I am assuming you are on the pill, and if you are not on the pill, you are at risk of becoming pregnant.\n\nComment: I am not on the pill and I am not going to take the pill. I don't want to have kids at all. I don't want to be pregnant.\n\nComment: Do you have other forms of protection?\n\nComment: Yes, I have condoms, but I don't want to have sex.\n\nAnswer: I think that it should be up to you, but you should be careful.  You could get an STD or become pregnant.\n\nComment: I know I am at risk of pregnancy and STDs. That is not the problem. I am just trying to decide if it is ok to cheat on him since he cheated on me first.\n\nComment: I am not saying it is right to cheat, but if he has cheated on you, it is a sign that he does not respect your relationship.  If you have to cheat to get revenge, I would not recommend it.\n\nComment: I just want to walk away from this. I am tired of talking to him. I am tired of trying to avoid the subject. I am just tired of him in general.\n\nComment: I would just leave him.  It will be hard, but if you are not happy it is not worth it.\n\nAnswer: First of all, I am really sorry that you are having to go through this. I have been in your shoes and I can tell you it is not easy.\n\nI think that you should talk with your boyfriend and tell him that you know he is cheating on you and you don't want to be with him anymore. I know that it is difficult and it can make you feel vulnerable, but you need to be honest with him. He needs to know that you know this is happening.\n\nIf you do decide to talk with him, I would also bring up the subject of you cheating. I would explain that if he is cheating on you, you would like to have the same freedom.\n\nI know that it is hard to see the bright side of any situation when you are so hurt, but I think that this can be a good thing.

Either way, I think that", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIs it ok to cheat on my bf since he cheated on me first?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo. It is never okay to cheat.  In fact, in most jurisdictions in the world today, it is illegal to cheat on your spouse.  There are many reasons why cheating is wrong.  It causes emotional harm.  It causes legal harm.  It causes physical harm.  Your boyfriend may have cheated on you, but that does not mean you get to cheat on him.\n\nComment: It is not a \"legal harm\" if you are not married, unless one of the people involved is married to someone else.\n\nComment: @user43211:  While that is true, a person can still be prosecuted for adultery if the other person is married.

I'm just thinking of breaking up with him and finding myself before I get into another relationship. But I'm not sure if he'll still be there for me.\n\nAnswer: I know a lot of people do it but I think it's wrong. If you cheated on him, you're basically telling him that it's okay for him to do the same thing to you, and if he does it's your fault because you cheated on him first. It's not a good way to get revenge because you'll just feel worse about yourself and it will bring out the worst in him.\n\nComment: I know it's wrong.

Cheating is not really the answer to cheating. You will both end up hurt.\n\nAnswer: No it isn't.  It's just a continuation of the cheating.  You'd both just be a pair of cheaters.\n\nAnswer: I think that we all know the answer to this question.  If you are dating someone, then you should be exclusive to each other.  Cheating is a betrayal of that trust.  If he cheated on you, then it means that he is not trustworthy and that he is not worth your time.  But that does not validate your cheating on him.  That is just a vicious cycle and you are both just hurting each other.  I don't think that you would want to be with someone like that.\n\nAnswer: No, it's not.\n\nCheating is not acceptable, and if you do it, you will be hurting the other person, even if they did do something you didn't like.", "This is very much a matter of personal opinion, but I don't think it's okay.  It's also a matter of how you define \"cheated.\"  If you were in a monogamous relationship (whether or not you or your boyfriend agreed to that) and he had sex with someone else, then yes, he \"cheated\" on you, even if you didn't have sex with someone else (yet).  In that case, I think it's understandable why you would want to \"even the score,\" but I think it's still a bad idea.  It's not going to change anything.  The damage is done, and you'll just make things worse for yourself.\n\nI think the best thing to do is talk to your boyfriend about it.  Tell him how you feel, that you're disappointed in him and that it hurts you.  Let him know that you're still mad at him.  Make it clear that you're not going to sleep with anyone else because you don't want to hurt him (or anyone else) the way he hurt you.  You might even tell him that you don't want to be with him anymore, at least for a while.  If you're not ready to break up with him, then you can tell him you're ready to give it another shot and try to work things out.  He may even ask for that opportunity.  It will be a hard conversation to have, but I think it's the most mature thing you can do.\n\nComment: If the boyfriend cheated, then yes. A bit of tit-for-tat is fair, and in fact often necessary. It may teach him a lesson, and it may also teach both of you something about yourself.\n\nComment: I think you're looking at it from the wrong perspective.  If he cheated on you, then you're the one who's been wronged.  Cheating is a form of betrayal.  You didn't do anything wrong, so you don't need to \"even the score.\"  Even if you do decide to cheat on him, it's still not going to make him feel better, and he'll still be hurt.  It's not going to solve your problem.  In fact, if you decide to cheat on him, it might make things worse, because now you're hurting him in the same way that he hurt you.\n\nComment: It can work just the same way as revenge.  It can make the pain worse, but it can also be cathartic.  The boyfriend won't be the only one to suffer.  I believe that it is the most effective way to teach this boyfriend a lesson.\n\nComment: @EugeneSh. - I don't agree.  Cheating is a very personal thing.  It's a betrayal of trust.  If you cheat on him, it's still going to hurt him, and it will still hurt you, too.  It may help you feel better temporarily, but it won't really solve the problem.  You should discuss your feelings with him.  Tell him how you feel.  If you want to break up with him, then you can do that, but if you decide to work things out, then you can try to have an open and honest relationship with him.\n\nComment: @Sarah: What if the boyfriend has a history of cheating and she's tired of it? What if she doesn't want to have an open and honest relationship with him?\n\nComment: @EugeneSh.:  Then she can decide to break up with him and find someone else.  She shouldn't cheat on him, though, because that will just make things worse.\n\nComment: @Sarah: I disagree.  If she's tired of cheating, cheating again won't make her feel better.  And if she's tired of cheating, then she's not willing to have an open and honest relationship.\n\nComment: @EugeneSh.:  I disagree.  You don't solve problems by cheating on someone.  If you want to cheat on him, then you can, but you'll have to accept the consequences.  You'll hurt him.  You'll hurt yourself.  It won't make you feel better, because you'll still be upset that he cheated on you.  You'll be hurting him in the same way that he hurt you.  If you want"]}

But it's still a joke.\n\nComment: @TimLymington: Well, I've heard people use the NYT in a *sarcastic* way, but I don't recall anyone being seriously \"antisemitic\" about it.  I wonder if it's because they think \"Jews\" are so rich that the NYT is a newspaper they'd all want to read.\n\nComment: @FumbleFingers: Well, yes. But that doesn't mean that the joke isn't antisemitic in nature.\n\nComment: @TimLymington: Well, I still don't see how you can suggest it's *offensive* if the people you know aren't offended by it.  You don't have to be Jewish to say \"the New York Times is a joke\" - I certainly don't think it's offensive in any way.

{"prompt": "What's the best strategy for playing monopoly?", "response_list": ["Strategy is complicated.\n\nThe basic strategy is to buy the most expensive property you can afford and not to rent it out.  If you buy a property, keep it.  If someone else buys a property you were thinking of buying, reevaluate.  Consider buying a property when it is likely that someone else will buy it.  If you see a property that is likely to be bought before you can buy it, buy it.  If you see a property that no one is buying, consider buying it.  If you buy a property, build a hotel.  If you can't afford to build a hotel, buy a hotel from someone else.  If someone buys a property and you cannot afford to buy it or build a hotel, you will not be able to afford to rent the property.\n\nThe long term strategy is to buy property and hotels.  If someone buys a property, buy it.  If someone buys a property that you were hoping to buy, buy it.  If you buy a property, build a hotel.  If you cannot afford to build a hotel, buy a hotel from someone else.  The game is over when there is no property left, so the last property is worth the most.  At the end, the person who owns the most property will win.\n\nThe short-term strategy is to not buy property.  If someone buys a property, don't buy it.  If someone buys a property that you were hoping to buy, don't buy it.  If someone buys a property and you cannot afford to buy it or build a hotel, you will not be able to afford to rent the property.  The game is over if there is no property left, so the last property is worth the most.  At the end, the person who owns the most property will win.\n\nComment: This is a great answer. I would add that you should also be aware of the value of the properties left in the game. If the others are buying all the good properties then you might want to keep your money for the end game. If you're playing with a big group of players then it's possible that there will be a lot of good properties left to buy at the end.\n\nComment: This is a good answer.  If you are the one buying last property, it may be a good idea to buy it on the last turn.  If you buy it in an earlier turn, you can be left with debts and no money for the last turn.  If you buy it on the last turn, you pay all the debts then and you have money for the last turn.  I'm not sure how this works with the other strategies.\n\nComment: Yes, that's why you want to be the last one to buy property.  But, if you are the last one, you probably won't get a good property.  If you buy it in an earlier turn, you have a chance to buy a good property.  If you buy a property but cannot afford to build a hotel, you will not be able to rent the property.  If you buy a property and cannot afford to rent it, you will not be able to afford to buy it.  If you buy a property and cannot afford to rent it, you will not be able to afford to build a hotel.\n\nComment: Is it possible to buy a hotel on a property you do not own?\n\nComment: Yes, you can buy a hotel on a property you don't own.  You can buy a hotel on a property you do own.  You can buy a hotel on a property you don't own and you can buy a hotel on a property you do own.\n\nAnswer: When I'm playing Monopoly with my family, we just have a lot of fun, without any strategy.\n\nBut if you're playing with people you don't know so well, you can try to make them think you're following one of the strategies mentioned in the previous answers, and then deviate from it when it's your turn.\n\nAnswer: Buy a property, build a hotel, and then buy the rest of the properties.", "The best strategy for playing monopoly is to spend the entire game collecting as many houses and hotels as possible, and to then use the hotels to maximise your rents.\n\nIf you can get all 4 houses on a square, and you put houses on all of them, you will receive $120 per turn.\n\nComment: I don't think this is the best strategy.

Please do.\n\nComment: @Zach: This is a difficult question to answer, because it's hard to measure the effectiveness of all the strategies (in terms of probability of winning).  One thing I've done is play a number of games, and to keep track of the strategies people used.  I've been able to notice some patterns.  For example, if you never pass \"Go\", then you almost never win.  I think the best strategy is a combination of a few things: build houses on some of your best properties, get money when other people land on your properties, and avoid the \"go to jail\" space as much as possible.\n\nComment: +1 for the idea of trying to make your properties the ones that people are the most likely to land on.\n\nComment: I'd guess that, although it might be a really long time, the best strategy is to collect as many houses and hotels as possible, then use them to maximize your rent, and, if necessary, put houses on all of the properties you own to collect $120 per turn.  Then, if you have enough houses and hotels (and, of course, money), you'll be able to control the game and win.\n\nComment: @Zach:  I agree with you that it is difficult to prove the effectiveness of all the strategies.  But, if you look at the rules, it seems that the best strategy is to maximize your rents and minimize the time you spend in jail.  The second best strategy is to collect money from other people when they land on your properties.  The third best strategy is to collect $200 every time you pass go.  The fourth best strategy is to collect $25 every time you pass go, and the fifth best strategy is to collect $200 every time you pass go.\n\nComment: The best strategy is to make sure you have the most houses and hotels.  The best way to do this is to avoid jail and the penalty squares, so that you can keep playing and collecting properties.  If you are in jail, you should only come out if you can afford to buy a property.

The game's designers made the mistake of giving players opportunities to acquire large amounts of money by landing on various spaces.  The flip side of this is that players have the opportunity to lose money when they have to pay other players rent.  The key to winning this game is to get money early and then to avoid a situation where you'll have to pay lots of money to other players.\n\nThe way to win is to get out of the game first by either being the first player to get $10,000 or the first player to have no assets.  Either way, you're out of the game.\n\nThis is the best strategy for all players of Monopoly, not just the first player.  The first player should choose to get out of the game as soon as possible.  Once the first player is out of the game, the next player who gets $10,000 should get out of the game.  If there are no players left who have $10,000, then the player who has the most money should get out of the game.\n\nThis strategy is the best one because it's the only one that guarantees that you'll win the game.  Getting to $10,000 first is better than getting the most money.  Getting $10,000 first is better than getting out of the game with no assets.  It's actually better to get out of the game with $10,000 than to get out with $1,000,000.  If you get out of the game with $1,000,000, you might get landed on while you have your head in the clouds and lose everything.  This will happen to you often enough that it's actually better to get out of the game with $10,000 than with $1,000,000.\n\nComment: I think this is incorrect, because you're ignoring the fact that you can get more money from passing go, from houses, and from trading.\n\nComment: @DougM It's true that you can get more money from houses and passing go.  It's true that you can also lose money from trading, and you can lose money from landing on spaces that make you pay other players.  I'm not ignoring any of these things.  I'm just saying that the best strategy is to get out of the game as soon as possible.  The rest of my answer explains why this is the best strategy.\n\nComment: @DougM If you have houses and you have the opportunity to trade them for more houses, you're going to be better off than you would be if you didn't trade them.  If you don't trade them, you're giving money to another player.  If you do trade them, you're still giving money to another player but you're also getting money for it.  It's better to get money than to get nothing, and it's better to get more money than to get less money.  The best strategy is to get out of the game as soon as possible because if you don't, you're going to start losing all of the money that you've made.\n\nComment: @DougM The best strategy is to get out of the game as soon as possible.

The", "In my experience, the best strategy is to play it fast and loose.\n\n\\strong{Fast}\n\nEvery time you land on a property owned by someone else, pay them as quickly as possible. Do not look at the board and try to calculate your odds of landing on a property owned by that person again. If you think that you've paid too much for a property, then you should offer to buy it from the owner for a lower amount.\n\nIf you don't like the owner's answer, then move on. This is also good advice for negotiating with the Bank. When you don't like the Bank's answer, then move on.\n\n\\strong{Loose}\n\nDon't buy every property that you land on. If you've got some cash and you land on a property owned by someone else, then it's a good idea to buy that property. But sometimes it's even smarter to just keep moving.\n\nIf you're playing with a good player, then he or she is going to buy as many properties as they can. When you land on a property owned by a good player, you are likely to pay more than you would have if you had bought that property yourself.\n\nIf you're playing with a not-so-good player, then you may be able to get away with buying less property. If you don't like the price that a not-so-good player is asking for a property, then you may be able to get it for a lower amount.\n\nAnswer: There are three ways to play Monopoly:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The \"real\" way to play is to trade, trade, trade.  Players should move around the board looking for trades, not trying to buy as much as possible.  This is the best strategy.\n\\item The \"common\" way to play is to buy as much as possible.  This is also a very good strategy, but it relies on luck.  It is a good strategy to use when you can't trade.\n\\item The \"stupid\" way to play is to buy and collect.  This is a terrible strategy, and you should never do it.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: I have seen a lot of players who have played the \"stupid\" way and won.\n\nComment: This is a very nice answer, but I would like to add a word of caution: The \"common\" way to play is not always a good strategy.

You're welcome to leave your own answer, if you're interested in doing so.\n\nAnswer: We have only been looking for alien signals for a few decades. Our technology is not yet good enough to detect life across the galaxy. We need to be able to detect radio signals from light years away, and we cannot yet do that.\n\nWe have only been looking for alien signals for a few decades. Our technology", "This is a popular topic in the field of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence), and a lot of research has been done on the topic.  You can read details in the [SETI Institute's FAQ](http://www.seti.org/faq#2).\n\nThe short answer to your question is that we will make first contact with aliens when we discover them.  We don't have to develop our own technology to detect them; we can detect them using our current technology.  The problem is that we don't know how to look for them.  We don't know what they might look like, and we don't know where to look for them.  And if we can't find them, we'll never make first contact.\n\nThe most advanced search technique we have is listening for radio transmissions from alien civilizations.  The most famous example is the [Wow! Signal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal), a possibly alien radio signal detected by the Big Ear radio telescope in 1977.  However, we have not found any unnatural radio signals in the 40 years since.\n\nThe best way to find aliens is to look for them in the [habitable zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitable_zone) of their parent star.  We know of more than 500 planets orbiting other stars, and we are discovering more all the time.  However, we haven't really investigated any of them at all.  The closest we have come is the [Kepler mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_%28spacecraft%29), which is looking for planets around other stars by looking for the transits of planets across the light of their parent stars.  To detect a transit, the planet has to block a significant fraction of the parent star's light, and the orbit of the planet has to be edge-on to us.  We haven't found any planets transiting their parent stars yet, but we have only been looking a few years.\n\nWe have also [been looking for alien artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_artifacts) in the Solar System, such as alien probes or the wreckage of interstellar spaceships.  We haven't found any yet, but we also haven't been looking very hard, and it's unlikely that such artifacts are just lying around.  We have also looked for alien artifacts around other stars, such as [the star HD 101065](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_101065) and [the star KIC 8462852](http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2015/12/the-strange-star-kic-8462852-now-has-an-explanation.html), but we haven't found anything there either.\n\nIn short, we don't know how to find them, and we have not found any evidence of their existence.  We have been looking for them for a long time.  We have been looking for radio signals for decades.  We have been looking for alien artifacts for a century.  We have been looking for planets outside of our Solar System for a few years.  We have not found them yet.\n\nSo we are likely to make first contact with aliens when we find them, and we are likely to find them in the next few decades.  We have the technology to detect them, we just don't know how to use it.\n\nComment: +1 for the \"we are likely to find them in the next few decades.\" That's the sentiment that I was trying to convey.\n\nComment: @Jim2B: If you want to convey that, you should write it in your question.  I wrote the answer I did because it's the answer to your question.  If you want to ask a different question, you should ask a different question.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer, but my question is about the *thought process* and what it would take to get to that point.  It's not an exact duplicate of the existing question, but similar.\n\nComment: @Jim2B: Then you should edit your question to say that.\n\nComment", "\\section{We will never make first contact}\n\nWe might well stumble across something that's intelligent, but it's entirely possible that we're not in a position to detect it.\n\nFor example, we might find that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. If so, how would we ever find them, given that we're limited to the observable universe? Even if they were very common, it's entirely possible that they're all so far away that we'd never find them in our lifetimes.\n\nWe could also find that we're not even detectable to them, or that we're uninteresting to them, or that we're invisible to them.\n\n\\section{We cannot make first contact}\n\nWe might find that there is intelligent life somewhere in the universe, but it's not in a position to make contact with us.\n\nFor example, we might find that they're all very far away, or that they've all gone extinct, or that they're all at war with each other and we're not on their priority list to contact.\n\n\\section{We could make first contact, but we probably won't}\n\nWe could find that there is intelligent life that is both common in the universe and in a position to make contact with us, but it might not actually happen. If we're the only ones that are interested, or we're the only ones with the technology, or we're the only ones that are currently in a position to contact them, or we're the only ones that have discovered them, it's entirely possible that we'll never make contact.\n\nComment: Not to mention the idea that we may contact them, but they may not want to contact us.\n\nComment: +1. I think the chances of us making first contact are pretty much zero. Our own communication abilities are extremely limited, and there are an astronomical number of planets out there that may have intelligent life. Even if there are just a billion billion planets in the universe that can support life, and just one of them has intelligent life, the odds of us ever contacting them are extremely small.\n\nAnswer: It's not clear at all whether we could make any form of contact with aliens.\n\nThe key is that we have no idea what aliens would be like, so we have no idea whether any form of communication would be possible.\n\nIf aliens are made of matter, perhaps there's some way we could make contact. If they are made of energy, perhaps there's some way we could make contact. If they're a completely different form of life, perhaps we could make contact. If they're too far away, perhaps we could make contact. If they're too close, perhaps we could make contact.\n\nBut we have no idea what aliens are like, so we have no idea about any of those questions.\n\nComment: I'm pretty sure you can't make contact with aliens made of energy.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what you mean by 'made of energy'. If you're talking about a physical object that's made of energy, then we've gotten pretty close to making contact with a physical object made of energy with the [CERN Large Hadron Collider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider).\n\nComment: @David I mean they are basically energy, no physical bodies.\n\nComment: @JoshRumbbles: It is possible to make contact with energy. We can detect it with instruments, and we can interact with it in certain ways.\n\nComment: @David - if you're talking about the LHC, it's not making contact with energy, it's making contact with matter.\n\nComment: @JoshRumbbles: Yes, I mean that the LHC is able to detect energy and make contact with it.\n\nComment: @David - it can detect it, but it can't make contact with it. It can only make contact with matter, which is made up of energy.\n\nComment: @JoshRumbbles: \"Made up of\" != \"is\"\n\nComment: @David - well, yes. I'm saying that the LHC can make contact with matter, and that is an object made of energy.\n\nComment: @JoshRumbbles: I'm saying that the LHC can't make contact with matter, it can only make contact with matter.\n\nAnswer: \\section", "I have written a whole novel (not yet published) about this, so this answer is going to be a bit long.  I think that it would take a long time to detect extraterrestrial intelligence, because if it exists it would be very rare \u2014 so rare it might be possible to calculate the probability of contact in a single lifetime.\n\nFirst, the Drake Equation\n\n\\begin{equation}\nN = R \\cdot f_p \\cdot n_e \\cdot f_l \\cdot f_i \\cdot f_c \\cdot f_L\n\\end{equation}\n\nis a rough estimate of the number of extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy, where\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item N is the number of civilizations in our galaxy\n\\item R is the average rate of formation of stars like the sun\n\\item f_p is the fraction of these that have planets\n\\item n_e is the average number of planets that can potentially support life\n\\item f_l is the average fraction of these planets that actually develop life\n\\item f_i is the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life\n\\item f_c is the fraction of these that actually develop a civilization that can communicate\n\\item f_L is the fraction of these that are detectable\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThere are a few assumptions that come into play here.  The first is that there are only a few types of life; the second is that these types of life only evolve in certain types of environments.  The third is that these types of life only develop intelligence in certain types of environments.  All of this is very speculative.  For example, there is no reason to assume that life can only exist in habitable zones around stars.  Life can exist in unthinkable conditions, so it is possible that it exists in all sorts of places.  In fact, life could exist in so many places that the factors in the Drake Equation are not useful.  If life is found on a rock in the solar system then we can say that life can exist in a range of temperatures, pressures and chemical conditions, so the Drake Equation is useless.  If life is found on Venus or Titan, then the conditions are quite different from Earth.\n\nOf course, if life exists in a range of conditions, then it is not very likely that it will evolve intelligence.  To evolve intelligence, a planet must have something like a large moon that can influence the planet's tides, like the Earth and the Moon have.  The tides in the oceans of the Earth create a huge amount of kinetic energy that is released as heat, and this heat drives the Earth's atmosphere.  Without a large moon, or some other large object in the solar system that can heat the earth, the earth would be a cold, dead rock.  Without plate tectonics, which are driven by the kinetic energy of the oceans, the earth would not be capable of supporting life.  If there are not enough tectonic plates, then the earth's crust would be too thick to allow plate tectonics, and the atmosphere would not be breathable.  Perhaps we could find life in some kind of undersea volcanic vent, but that is quite a different kind of life, and it is very different from a planet like the Earth.\n\nThe point is that if we want to detect intelligent life, we need to find a planet that is very similar to Earth.  The next problem is that the evolution of life is very slow.  The time that it takes for a planet to develop life is on the order of tens of millions of years.  The time that it takes for life to evolve intelligence is on the order of hundreds of millions of years.  That is a long time to wait for intelligent life to evolve.  If we find life on Mars, or on Titan, or on Venus, then it is not going to be very interesting.  We could find life on Europa, but that would also be very slow.  To find the kind of intelligent life that we are looking for, we need to find a planet that is very similar to Earth, and we need to wait for a very long time.  It is not even clear that an alien civilization would be able to communicate with us.\n\nSo what are the chances of finding a planet like Earth, that is in our galaxy, and that is very similar to Earth in all respects, and that has intelligent life?  Well, the galaxy is very big, and", "The question is not really answerable. For example, if the aliens are already here, then the answer is \"now\". If they are very far away, then the answer is \"never\" or \"a very long time\".\n\nTo communicate, you need to send a message and get a reply. For radio waves, it takes about 4 light-years for a message to travel between stars. So we can't really communicate with anything more than about 4 light-years away. The nearest star to us is 4 light-years away, so this rules out the nearest stars as possible destinations.\n\nWhen we talk to aliens, we must use some sort of language. Humans use spoken language, but it is not the only possible language. Some aliens might use pictures, or songs, or numbers. So we have to develop a communication system to talk to aliens.\n\nWhen we talk to aliens, we have to use something to talk \\em{about}.

I think it would be easier to find a similar language than to find a different communication system. I want to believe that we can communicate with any alien.\n\nComment: @Liam: The point is that language and communication system are not the same.  Humans use spoken language, but pictures can be a language, and so can musical tones, and so on.  If we find a species that uses a different communication system, then we can't talk to them until we develop a system to translate between our languages.  For example, we can't talk to dolphins because we don't know their language.\n\nComment: @Liam: Even if they used a similar language, it would take a long time to find them.  It takes 4 years for a message to go from Earth to Mars, which is less than 1 light-year away.  And even if they use a similar language, there is no guarantee that we would ever find them.  It's *possible* that life evolved on Earth and didn't evolve anywhere else, and it's possible that life evolved elsewhere in the universe but not here.\n\nComment: @Liam: The same is true of communication system.  We don't know that the aliens use radio waves, or visible light, or something else entirely.  If they don't use radio waves, then it's impossible to send them a radio message.  We would need to develop a system for sending a message that they can receive.  For example, we can't talk to dolphins because we don't know their language, but it's also hard to talk to them because they have sonar and we don't.  We have to figure out what they use for sonar and develop a system to use it.\n\nComment: @Liam: Even if we find a language that is similar to ours, it will take a long time to find them.

So in that sense, it's good.\n\nComment: @Matt: I'm not sure what you mean.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: I mean that if you are raised Christian you have the choice to stay Christian or not. It's not like Islam or Hinduism, where if you are born into a Muslim/Hindu family, you are practicing that religion.\n\nComment: @Matt: I believe that is true.  But at the same time, it's not as if you are given a choice of religion when you're born.  You are Christian by default.  And in America, you have to take action to be anything other than Christian.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: You're right about that. There's a tendency in America (and some other countries) to assume that everyone is a Christian, which is not true. But there are still many people who are born Christian and choose to practice it.\n\nComment: @Matt: I'm saying that because you are born into a Christian family, you are automatically Christian.  You're not given the choice to be anything else.  And in America, you have to take action to be something other than Christian.  For example: You have to declare that you are Jewish, or Agnostic, or Muslim, or whatever.  But it's not the same to be something other than Christian.  You don't have to declare it.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: True, you don't have to declare it. But you are given the choice. You can choose to practice being Christian or not. You can choose to believe in the teachings of the Bible or not.\n\nComment: @Matt: Not really.  I'm Christian because I was born into a Christian family.  I don't have to declare it.  I'm not a Muslim because I wasn't born into a Muslim family.  I would have to declare that.  In America you have to declare a religion (other than Christian) to be anything other than Christian.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: Okay, so you're Christian because you were born into a Christian family. But, if you didn't want to be Christian, you could choose to stop practicing it.\n\nComment: @Matt: But I don't want to stop practicing it.  I was just born into a Christian family.  I didn't have a choice.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: True, you didn't have a choice. But you could have chosen not to be a Christian.\n\nComment: @Matt: Yes, but I don't want to.  I want to be a Christian.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: Right. But, if you didn't want to be a Christian, you could choose not to be one.\n\nComment: @Matt: True, but I don't want to.  I don't know what else to say.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: Okay, I think we're done here :)\n\nAnswer: The main pro of being born Christian is that you have a direct connection to God, as well as a very strong support group.\n\nThe con of being born Christian is that you have to live your life according to the rules of this religion and also that you have to follow a", "Pros\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item

{"prompt": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of working at a startup compared to working at a tech giant?", "response_list": ["You're going to have to work harder at a startup. You can be sure that the people at Google or Facebook are really good at their jobs. In a startup, you're going to have to prove yourself.\n\nThe upside is that you can have a huge impact on the company. You can get involved in more areas, learn more, and make a greater contribution.\n\nYou're also going to be challenged in different ways. A lot of the problems you'll work on at a startup are going to be new and different. You'll have to learn new things about the problem domain and new things about the technologies you use.\n\nYou can expect to be handsomely rewarded for your contribution. If you're a good engineer, you can get a lot of money from a startup.\n\nComment: I've been at one startup that went bankrupt (it was not my fault :-) and one that is now a tech giant. I prefer the giant.\n\nComment: @S.Lott I think the biggest thing is the culture. Google is a good example. They have pretty much the best work environment you could possibly hope for.\n\nComment: I find it hard to believe that most startups offer better pay than a tech giant.  But, perhaps that's just because I'd rather work for a tech giant in the long run.", "I don't think there is any clear cut answer to this question. I have worked at both environments and here's my take:\n\n\\strong{Strengths of a Startup:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item There is a huge opportunity to learn and evolve through the process of working in a startup. Due to the fast paced nature of a startup, you are likely to be pushed in to learning new things and also to apply all your skills to make a difference.\n\\item More autonomy to do work. You can be more hands on and take up responsibilities. This is a very important point for me. I personally do not like to be told what to do but rather be given a task and allowed to come up with ways to achieve it.\n\\item You'll usually work directly with the core team. You don't have to go through the hierarchy to get your work done. This can be a double edged sword but I'll explain why in the next point.\n\\item You will be more visible. You may be part of the core team and your opinion will be more valued.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Weaknesses of a Startup:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You will have less resources to work with. You'll have to be more creative and resourceful to get your work done.\n\\item You will not have much of a support system. You'll have to work on your own more often.\n\\item You'll have to do more work than the big companies. The amount of work will be much higher.\n\\item You'll have to work more hours. Most startups will have you working late into the night.\n\\item The compensation might not be as good as the big tech giants.\n\\item You might be pulled in to other areas of the business where you're not skilled.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Strengths of a Tech Giant:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item More money. You'll have more resources and more financial muscle to work with.\n\\item Better brand recognition. You'll get better opportunities to work with bigger clients, better pay for consulting work etc.\n\\item Better healthcare and other benefits.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Weaknesses of a Tech Giant:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item More bureaucracy. As they are much larger companies, more decisions must be made. This can lead to a lot of red tape and slow decision making.\n\\item You will have a strict hierarchy. You'll have to go through the hierarchy to get your work done.\n\\item You'll have less visibility. You won't be part of the core team and your opinion will not be valued as much.\n\\item Less autonomy to do work. You'll have to follow orders and do things the way they want it to be done.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{My Pick:} I would work in a startup. I've worked in both environments and I personally prefer working in a startup. I think there's more learning and more growth opportunities in a startup than a tech giant. However, I do believe that working in a tech giant has its own strengths.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Strengths of startups:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item You get to work with the latest technologies and get exposed to a lot of new stuff.\n\\item Opportunity to work with a small group of people. There is more interaction with the team members\n\\item More challenging work than the usual.\n\\item Work in a fast-paced environment.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Weaknesses of startups:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Less pay.\n\\item Less flexibility.

This is exactly the kind of answer I was hoping for.  I'd be interested in hearing more about the \"risks and new things\" a startup is willing to take.  What does that look like?  How does it compare to working at a tech giant?\n\nComment: A tech giant is likely to have more resources and a wider range of opportunities than a small one.\n\nComment: @Robert Harvey I think that's what you meant to say, not \"young\".\n\nComment: @RiggsFolly: I think that depends on his age.  But \"young\" is definitely the better term for \"startup\".\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey I would agree with that :)\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey Thanks for the help!  I updated the title of my question.\n\nComment: That's not necessarily true.  The startup might offer more opportunities and the giant may have more resources.  The startup may be more risk-averse and the giant may be more willing to take risks.  You can't really generalize.\n\nComment: @Robert Harvey - A startup may offer more opportunities, but it's more likely that there are fewer opportunities.  That's why they're a startup.\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey: A startup might be a small company, but it can be a big company as well.  I've worked at companies which started out as a small company and then grew to be a big one.\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey - \"A big company is likely to have more resources and a wider range of opportunities than a small one.\"  No, it's not.  The company might be big, but it might have a tiny fraction of the resources and opportunities of a big company.  The resources and opportunities will be proportional to the company's size.\n\nComment: @Robert Harvey -  I was talking about a \"Startup\" not a \"Small Company\".  A Startup is a particular type of company.  One that has just started and is looking to grow.\n\nComment: @Robert Harvey - You can have companies that grow to become a \"Startup\" or a \"Big Company\" and then, over time, they can change to a \"Small Company\".  But that is not the same as a startup.\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey: \"A tech giant is likely to have more resources and a wider range of opportunities than a small one.\"  No, it's not, as I've just said.\n\nComment: @Robert Harvey -  A Startup is a very small company, and is usually a company that has just started and is looking to grow.  It is not a small company.  There are lots of reasons why a small company might not grow, but that is not the same as a Startup.\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey: You can't generalize about the differences between startups and tech giants.  You can't generalize about the differences between startups and small companies.  I've worked at both startups and small companies, and it's not the same.  There is no difference between a tech giant and a small company in terms of the work they do.  The only difference is the size of the company.  That affects the opportunities and resources available, but it doesn't affect the work itself.\n\nComment: @RobertHarvey: You can't generalize about the differences between startups and tech giants.

{"prompt": "What makes learning Hebrew really hard for English speakers?", "response_list": ["Hebrew is a language that is written from right to left.  This is the opposite of English, which is written from left to right.\n\nBecause the language is written from right to left, it can make it difficult for English speakers to read because they are used to reading from left to right.  This can lead to confusion and mistakes when learning to read and write in Hebrew.\n\nAdditionally, Hebrew has a different alphabet than English, which can be confusing for English speakers to learn.  The Hebrew alphabet consists of 22 letters, which are different from the 26 letters in the English alphabet.  This can make it difficult for English speakers to pronounce words in Hebrew and can also make it difficult to read and write in Hebrew.\n\nHebrew also has a different grammatical structure than English, which can be confusing for English speakers.  Hebrew uses a different word order than English, which can make it difficult for English speakers to understand how to construct sentences in Hebrew.\n\nAdditionally, Hebrew has a different system of pronunciation than English, which can be confusing for English speakers.  Hebrew has a system of accents that are used to indicate different pronunciations of words, which can be difficult for English speakers to learn.\n\nOverall, the different writing direction, alphabet, grammar, and pronunciation can make learning Hebrew more difficult for English speakers than for native Hebrew speakers.\n\nComment: I think this is a good answer, the only thing I would add to this is that Hebrew is an inflected language, meaning that the way a word is written changes according to the way it is used in a sentence. For example, the word \"lo\" can mean \"not\" or \"to him\", depending on how it's written. This is different from English, where the word \"not\" is always written the same way, no matter how it is used in a sentence.\n\nComment: Overall, I would say that the main reason learning Hebrew is hard for English speakers is because it is a completely different language, with a different writing direction, alphabet, grammar, and pronunciation.\n\nComment: @Ariel, thank you for your comment.  Yes, you are right that Hebrew is an inflected language.  This means that the way a word is written can change depending on how it is used in a sentence.  I have edited my answer to include this information.", "The first thing that may be an issue for English speakers is the fact that Hebrew is a right-to-left language, but the English mindset is left-to-right.\n\nSecondly, Hebrew spelling is very phonetic, so the same letter combination will have the same pronunciation every time, regardless of the vowels that are used. This is the complete opposite of English, where the same letter combination can have many different pronunciations depending on the vowel that is used.\n\nThirdly, Hebrew has no written vowels. The reader has to figure out what vowels to use from the context.\n\nFinally, Hebrew has 22 letters, but those 22 letters can have many different pronunciations depending on their placement in the word and other rules that are applied. The 22 letters can even be used as 22 vowels, making the pronunciation of the word very complex.\n\nComment: This is a very good answer! I think that learning how to read Hebrew is easier than learning to write it, because writing requires using the proper pronunciation rules, which, as you said, are very complex. In addition, when you are writing, you are thinking of the spelling of the word (which is not the same as the pronunciation), which is also very complex.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nWhat makes learning Hebrew really hard for English speakers?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAside from the fact that English and Hebrew have very little in common, and learning any language is difficult, here are some specific reasons why learning Hebrew is difficult for English speakers:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Hebrew is read right-to-left, like Arabic, while English is read left-to-right, like many other European languages. This is a challenge for anyone who is used to reading left-to-right.\n\\item Hebrew is written without vowels, which makes it more difficult to pronounce words correctly. English, on the other hand, has plenty of vowels.\n\\item Hebrew is a very old language with many words that have changed their meaning over time. This can be confusing for English speakers who are used to more consistent word usage.\n\\item The grammar and sentence structure of Hebrew is very different from English. Hebrew has a lot of complex rules and exceptions that can be difficult to learn.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: In the case of English, the word \"left\" is an adjective, not a verb.  As such, it doesn't have a past tense.  \"I left.\"  \"I left home.\"\n\nComment: I think your first explanation is incorrect. Hebrew is written right to left, but English is read left to right.\n\nComment: @user72518 is correct. English is read left to right, but Hebrew is written right to left.\n\nComment: @user72518 is correct. I have edited the answer.\n\nAnswer: Learning Hebrew is hard because it is very different from English. Hebrew has a different alphabet, a different grammar, and a different word order. Hebrew also has a lot of unique words that don't exist in English.\n\nAnswer: The main problem for English speakers when learning Hebrew is that Hebrew is not an Indo-European language. This means that Hebrew has a completely different word order, grammar, and even some sounds. If you are an English speaker, learning Hebrew will be a much more difficult task than if you were learning a language that shares a lot of similarities with English.\n\nAnswer: Learning Hebrew can be difficult for English speakers because it is a language with its own unique alphabet and grammar. Hebrew is read from right to left, and the letters do not represent sounds the way they do in English. In addition, Hebrew is a very old language, with many words that have changed their meaning over time. This can make it difficult to learn the proper pronunciation of words. Finally, Hebrew has a very complex grammar, with many rules that are difficult to remember.", "Learning Hebrew is hard because the written language is quite different from the spoken language.

That is, there are no suffixes to change the form of a noun or verb. There are no tenses for verbs. There are no plurals for nouns.\n\nHebrew has an extremely rich inflection system: nouns change form depending on their case (who is speaking and who is spoken to), gender (male or female), number (single or plural), and state (whether it is a name or a thing). Verbs change form depending on who is speaking and who is spoken to, past, future, and present tenses, and other things.\n\nA simple sentence in Hebrew can be translated into English by a dozen or more words.

First of all, you will have to understand that most people who say they \"speak Chinese\" in the US don't actually speak Mandarin. That's not even a criticism; if you told me you could speak French I would assume you meant French, not Haitian Creole.\n\n\\section{Because most people in the US who \"speak Chinese\" can't}\n\nIn the US, \"Chinese\" is a very broad term that includes everything from Cantonese to Mandarin to Toisan to Hakka to Hmong to Korean. Of these, most people who claim to \"speak Chinese\" are really referring to Cantonese.\n\nCantonese is a dialect of Chinese that's most commonly used in Guangdong province, but is also used by a lot of people in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada, and the US.\n\n\\section{Because Cantonese is more useful}\n\nIf you're in China, you're going to need to learn Mandarin to get by, but if you're in the US, it's much more useful to know Cantonese.\n\nCantonese is spoken by about 50 million people worldwide, so there's a pretty good chance that it will be useful to you. Mandarin is spoken by 1.1 billion people, almost all of whom will be pretty useless to you unless you're trying to sell them something.\n\nCantonese also has a lot of speakers in the US. There are about 3 million US residents who speak Cantonese, and 1 million of those speak it as a first language. That's more than the number of Mandarin speakers, and a lot more than the number of Hakka or Toisan speakers.\n\n\\section{Because there's a huge difference between Mandarin and Cantonese}\n\nIf you speak Cantonese and you try to speak Mandarin, you're going to sound like you're speaking a completely different language. It's not like speaking Italian and Spanish: if you know Italian you can usually figure out what Spanish words mean. Cantonese and Mandarin have almost no similarities at all.\n\n\\section{Because it's easier to learn Cantonese}\n\nIf you're a native English speaker, you're going to have a lot less trouble learning Cantonese than Mandarin, because Cantonese has a lot more similarities to English.\n\nFor example, the Cantonese word \"jyutpiu\" means \"to play\". In Mandarin it's \"xiangqiu\". In English it's \"play\".\n\nIf you try to learn Mandarin, you're going to have to learn that the word for \"eight\" is \"ba\", which is also the word for \"eighty\". The word for \"three\" is \"san\", which is also the word for \"three hundred\". The word for \"one hundred\" is \"yi\", which is also the word for \"one\".\n\nIf you try to learn Cantonese you're going to have a similar problem, but with a lot less words. The word for \"eight\" is \"bat\", which is also the word for \"eighty\". The word for \"three\" is \"sat\", which is also the word for \"three hundred\". The word for \"one hundred\" is \"yat\", which is also the word for \"one\".\n\n\\section{Because it's easier to find Cantonese speakers}\n\nIf you're in the US, you're going to have a much easier time finding people who speak Cantonese than Mandarin. There are fewer Cantonese speakers, but they're a lot more spread out.\n\nIn the US, there are about 1.3 million Mandarin speakers, but only about 600,000 Cantonese speakers. But if you look at the distribution of Mandarin speakers, you'll see that most of them are in just a few states.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vn4b4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nIf you look at the distribution of Cantonese speakers, you'll see that they're much more spread out.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BxRRJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\n\\section{Because it's easier", "\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Language learning is not about being useful.

I think it's more about not necessary enough.  If you live in China, you need to speak Mandarin.  If you live in the US, you need to speak English.

This is a real problem in the US especially with jobs.\n\nComment: @Bill I think you're right. I do agree that speaking a language is not a requirement for a job. If a company wants someone to speak a language, they will ask for it.\n\nComment: Most people in the US do need to speak English. The US has a population of 300 million and ~100 million are native speakers of English. There are ~80 million native Spanish speakers in the US, but they are a minority.\n\nComment: @Bill - I think the point is that as a non-native speaker of English, you can get by in the US. I don't think the same is true for non-native speakers of Mandarin.\n\nComment: @JeffreyBosboom That's true, but I think you're overestimating the number of people that are only learning English because they have to.  Most of the students I was exposed to in college wanted to learn English out of curiosity and not because they needed to.  Many of them came from countries where English was the primary language, but they wanted to learn it in order to be able to better communicate with the US and the rest of the world.\n\nComment: @Bill: Most of the people I know who learned English as a second language did so because they needed to. Not because they wanted to.\n\nComment: @JeffreyBosboom - That's the point I was making.  It takes a certain amount of motivation to learn a language that you don't need to.  I think people in the US tend to have a bit more motivation than people in other countries, but I don't think they are a huge exception.\n\nComment: @JeffreyBosboom I think you're right about that. Mandarin is not the easiest language to learn and I don't think native English speakers will go through the trouble of learning it unless they really need it.\n\nComment: @Bill: I think you're underestimating the number of people who want to learn English because its fun.\n\nComment: Mandarin is the easiest language to learn. It's a tonal language, so it's a bit hard to get the pronunciation right, but it's not much harder than English, and the grammar is much simpler. Most people I know who learned Mandarin did so because they wanted to, not because they had to.\n\nComment: @JeffreyBosboom - I'm not sure I believe the \"want to\" aspect of it.

{"prompt": "What would have happened if the South won the Civil War?", "response_list": ["This question is not really answerable, because it would have depended on how the war ended and what happened afterwards.\n\nThe war ended with the surrender of the Confederacy. If the South had won, the war would have ended differently.\n\nThere are two possibilities: the South would have won the war outright, and the North would have been forced to give up and accept the South's independence. This is unlikely, because the North (with Europe) had much more military might than the South.\n\nThe other possibility is that the war would have ended inconclusively, with neither side winning. This does not seem likely, either, because the North was much better organized than the South.\n\nIf the war had ended in some kind of stalemate, the South could have tried to win independence later, with a new war. But the North would have had a much better chance of winning that war.\n\nThe war was over slavery. In that case, the South would have been a much more powerful country than it was historically. The North had more people, but the South had more land. Also, many Southerners were farmers, while the North was mostly industrial. This would have given the South an advantage in supplying the war effort, and perhaps in winning independence.\n\nBut this raises the question of how the slaves would have been treated. It is unlikely that the South would have freed them, because it would have been difficult to compete in a war without them. It is possible that the North might have freed them, but there is no evidence to suggest that they would have done so. It is more likely that the slaves would have been used as human shields, or perhaps as soldiers.\n\nIn this case, the North would have had to decide whether to fight a war to free the slaves. This would have been a very difficult decision, because it would have been hard to justify to the American people. It is more likely that the North would have tried to negotiate with the South to end slavery.\n\nThis would have been a very difficult negotiation, because the South would have had to give up a lot of economic power. Slavery was a very important part of the Southern economy, and without it, the South would have been much poorer than it was historically.\n\nIt is possible that the North would have won this negotiation, but it is more likely that the South would have won it. In that case, the war would have ended in a stalemate, and the South would have gained independence.\n\nHowever, this would have been a very short-lived independence. The North would have been much stronger than the South, and it is likely that they would have fought another war to reunite the country. In that case, the North would have won, and slavery would have been abolished.\n\nComment: The Civil War ended with the collapse of the Confederacy. \"Inconclusively\" would have meant that the South would have won the war.

They didn't have the resources or ability to do so.\n\nComment: @DarrelHoffman: You are right, the war would have ended with a North victory, but I think it is possible that it would have ended without the South being completely defeated.\n\nComment: @TylerH: The South would have been able to fight, because they would have had many more soldiers than they had historically.", "\\strong{The South would have become a separate country, and slavery would have been more widespread.}\n\nI think most people agree that the South would have become a separate country.\n\nThe question is more about the extent to which slavery would have been more widespread.\n\nThe South would have become a separate country, and slavery would have been more widespread. I don't think the South would have been able to maintain slavery indefinitely, and slavery would have gradually declined as it did in the U.S., but it would have persisted for a lot longer.\n\nComment: I would have to agree with this. I do wonder if, without the North's help, the South would have had the resources to last as long as they did.\n\nComment: @CortAmmon: The South might have been able to maintain itself longer without the North's help. It might have had a worse economy, but it might have been able to hold its own against European powers like Britain and France, which it would have needed to do to maintain its independence.", "I don't think there is a definitive answer to this question, but here are some things to consider:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The South would have continued to rely on slavery as a way to get their crops harvested. This would have continued to devalue the lives of African-Americans in the eyes of the white population.\n\\item The South would have continued to be a poorer region of the country. This would have had a negative impact on the economy as a whole.\n\\item The South would have continued to be a more violent place. This would have led to a higher crime rate and more unrest.\n\\item The South would have continued to be a hotbed for racism and bigotry. This would have had a negative impact on race relations in the United States.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: If the South had won the civil war, there would be no United States as we know it today. The Confederate States of America would be a separate country, and there would be no need for a war of independence from Great Britain. The United States would be a much smaller country, and it is possible that the south would have been able to keep slavery.\n\nAnswer: It is impossible to know for sure what would have happened if the South won the Civil War. However, it is possible to speculate. It is likely that the South would have continued to rely on slavery as a way to get their crops harvested. This would have continued to devalue the lives of African-Americans in the eyes of the white population. The South would have continued to be a poorer region of the country. This would have had a negative impact on the economy as a whole. The South would have continued to be a more violent place. This would have led to a higher crime rate and more unrest. The South would have continued to be a hotbed for racism and bigotry. This would have had a negative impact on race relations in the United States.", "The short answer is: We'd still have slavery today.\n\nThe longer answer is: The North had a strong industrial base, the South did not, and the South didn't have the resources to keep themselves going if they lost the North.\n\nThe North had a large population, the South didn't. The North has the money, the South didn't. The North had a strong navy, the South didn't.\n\nIn short, the South couldn't really win.\n\nComment: I really think that the South would have won the war because they had better leaders. Like Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South had better generals, but the North had more of them.\n\nComment: I'm not sure that the south had better generals at all.  The south's generals were better able to maneuver their forces, but they still lost every battle.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South had plenty of good generals. Jackson, Lee, Longstreet. Also, the idea that the North's generals were generally superior is a huge oversimplification.\n\nComment: Would you care to elaborate?\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South's generals were better tacticians. That's not to say that the North's generals weren't good tacticians, it's just that the South's were better.\n\nComment: It would be nice if you could give a reference for this.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generals_in_the_American_Civil_War\n\nComment: You just made it a whole lot worse.\n\nComment: The North had more of what? Generals?  Please explain.\n\nComment: @Dave: The North had more generals, meaning that the North had more good generals.\n\nComment: @Dave: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Civil_War_generals\n\nComment: So, the south had better tacticians and more generals?  I'm still not seeing the problem.\n\nComment: @Dave: The South had plenty of good tacticians, but they didn't have very good generals.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: But the North did.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: Well, the North had better generals.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South had better generals, but the North had more.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South had better generals, but they were outnumbered.\n\nComment: The South's generals were better tacticians?  Did you read that link you posted?  Lee's strategy was to constantly attack the Union army, thinking that he would eventually win.  The Union had much more of a strategic mindset, and won because of it.\n\nComment: @Dave: That's not true at all. The South lost because of its inferior manpower.\n\nComment: @Dave: The South lost because it couldn't keep up with the North in terms of manpower and other resources.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: I just want to point out that the South won more battles than the North. For instance, the South won the Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, and the Battle of Vicksburg.\n\nComment: \"The South had plenty of good generals. Jackson, Lee, Longstreet. Also, the idea that the North's generals were generally superior is a huge oversimplification.\"  I don't see a contradiction here.  You can have better tacticians and still lose.  There were some pretty bad generals on both sides.  The North won because they had more generals who knew the basics of tactics.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The North had more generals and the resources to supply them. The South didn't.\n\nComment: Also, the North had more good generals, not just more generals.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The North had better resources, better generals, and more generals.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The North had more resources, better generals, and more generals.\n\nComment: @Jonathan: The South had plenty of good generals, but they didn't have enough of them", "I don't know of any historians who think that the South would have gained its independence from the United States in a successful war. The Confederacy was an agrarian slave-holding society that simply lacked the industrial capacity to win a war against the United States.\n\nIf the South had won, I think it's more likely that the North and South would have entered into some kind of a federation, like the German Confederation of 1815-1867, or the Prussian-Austrian German Confederation of 1815-1866.\n\nComment: I think a federation is a bit of a stretch.  The North was willing to destroy the country rather than accept a federation.  The South was willing to destroy the country rather than accept a federation.  The only way a federation would have happened is if the South had won a stunning victory early in the war, or if the North had given up.  I don't think either of those two things was likely.\n\nComment: In 1865, after four years of war, the North had enough of the South to want to avoid it at all costs.  A federation would have guaranteed that.\n\nComment: But Lincoln did not want to avoid the South at all costs.  He was willing to destroy the South in order to keep it in the Union.\n\nComment: @yannis, you are right, I don't know of any historians who think that the South would have gained its independence from the United States in a successful war. However, it is a fact that the South *could* have gained its independence from the United States in a successful war.\n\nComment: I don't think the North would have stood for a federation.  The South was willing to break the country up and fight the North forever.  The North was willing to fight the South forever.  There would be no way to get the North to agree to a federation and then get the South to agree to it as well.\n\nComment: @yannis, I agree that it would have been a hard sell.  But I think that it would have been a sellable idea to a lot of Northerners in the first few years after the war.  I wouldn't be surprised if 40% of Northerners were ready to accept it in 1865.\n\nComment: How could it have been sold in 1865?  The war was over and the South was defeated.  The North wasn't going to accept a federation.  What reason would the South have to accept a federation?\n\nComment: @yannis, the South would have accepted a federation in order to avoid a reconstruction, and the North would have accepted a federation in order to avoid a long period of hostility with the South.\n\nComment: So what's the federation going to look like?  Is the South going to be a full member?  Are the slaves going to be freed?  How's the South going to be compensated for their loss?  How's the North going to be compensated for their loss?  How's the North going to feel about the South being a full member if the South is still pro-slavery?  And how's the South going to feel about a federation if the North is still pro-slavery?\n\nComment: @yannis, the North would have been willing to leave the South alone if the South was willing to leave the North alone.  The two regions would have been able to coexist without any significant hostility or animosity.  The South would have been able to continue to hold slaves and to practice slavery.  The North would have been able to continue to not hold slaves and to practice non-slavery.\n\nComment: So how does the North \"leave the South alone\"?  The South is going to continue to want to practice slavery.  How is the North going to leave them alone if they continue to practice slavery?  What is the North going to do if the South starts to practice slavery in the North?\n\nComment: @yannis, if the South had won a war of secession, the North would have had to allow the South to practice slavery.  The South could have continued to hold slaves in the South.\n\nComment: No, not really.  The North would have had to allow the South to practice slavery in the North.  The South would have had to allow the North to practice non-slavery in the South.\n\nComment: @yannis,"]}

For example:\n\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to get involved in politics.\n* People who get involved in politics are not necessarily the best people to run a country.\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to use force to get what they want.\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to lie to get what they want.\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to kill those who get in the way.\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to steal from others.\n* Centralized political power is a problem because it creates an incentive for people to destroy the environment.\n\n### The EU must be dismantled\n\nThe EU must be dismantled because it is a system that creates a lot of problems.", "I would like to see the EU re-focused on the original purpose, which was to make it easier for member states to trade with each other.\n\nOne problem is that the EU has become a centralised bureaucracy. It needs to be refocused on the principle of subsidiarity, whereby decisions are made at the lowest possible level.\n\nThere is also a problem with the EU's financial arrangements. A lot of money is spent on EU institutions, and members of the European Parliament who represent the constituencies of individual countries. There is no accountability for this money.\n\nHowever, I am in favour of the Common Agricultural Policy, which gives financial support to farmers. It is important that we support our farmers, because without them we would have no food security.\n\nThe EU needs to be more democratic. The European Parliament needs to be given more power. Currently, it can only be over-ruled by the European Council, which is made up of the heads of government of member states.\n\nThe European Parliament also needs to be given more power to scrutinise the decisions of the European Council.\n\nThe European Union needs to be reformed so that it is more democratic and more accountable.\n\n## Further reading\n\n* Barroso, Jos\u00e9 Manuel (2015).

In other words, the question is not well-defined.\n\nComment: @Mehrdad: The question asks for a *set* of all true formulas. This is a set of propositional formulas, and is decidable. If you want a set of all first order formulas, then it is decidable. If you want a set of all second order formulas, then it is undecidable.\n\nComment: This is not right. The set of all true propositional formulas is decidable. The set of all true formulas of a given type is a set of formulas of both types.\n\nComment: The question is not well-defined. The set of all true formulas of a given type is not a well-defined set.\n\nComment: @Mehrdad: The question is well-defined if we restrict the set of formulas to a particular type.\n\nComment: The question is not well-defined if we restrict the set of formulas to a particular type.\n\nComment: The set of all true formulas is not a set of formulas of a particular type.\n\nComment: There is no \"set of all true formulas\" because there is no set of all formulas.\n\nComment: @Mehrdad: The question is well-defined if you restrict it to a type. The set of all true formulas is a set of a particular type.\n\nComment: I don't understand what you are trying to say. If you restrict the question to a type, then the set of all true formulas of a given type is a well-defined set. If you restrict the question to a particular type, then you can't say that the set of all true formulas is a set of formulas of a given type.\n\nComment: @Mehrdad: You can restrict the set of formulas to a particular type and then say that the set of all true formulas is a set of formulas of that type. The set of all true formulas is a set of propositional formulas.\n\nComment: Thank you. That makes sense now.\n\nAnswer: The set of all true formulas is not well-defined. That's because there is no set of all formulas.\n\nComment: That's because you can't construct the set of all formulas, because there are infinitely many formulas.\n\nComment: @Mehrdad: A set is the same thing as a collection. It is true that the collection of all formulas can't be constructed, but there are other collections that can. The collection of all true formulas can be constructed.\n\nComment: You are right. The set of all true formulas can be constructed.\n\nAnswer: The set of all true formulas is not well-defined. You can't construct the set of all formulas.\n\nComment: You can construct a set of all true formulas, and you can construct a set of all formulas of a given type.\n\nComment: No, you can't construct a set of all true formulas.\n\nComment: You can construct a set of all true formulas.\n\nComment: No, you can't. You can't construct the set of all formulas. The set of all formulas is not a well-defined set.\n\nComment", "I don't know much about your field, but I'm pretty sure the answer is no. The reason I say this is because if you already know how to prove P != NP, then you can do that to prove P != NP^P.\n\nIf you're asking if it's possible that P=NP^P, then I would say no, since a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP^P-hardness would be a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP-hardness, which is known not to exist.\n\nComment: I think you've misread the question.  I don't think the OP is asking whether P^NP^NP can be proved to be in P.  I think he's asking whether we can prove P^NP^NP is NP^NP and P^NP^NP^NP is P^NP.\n\nComment: @JoshuaZ: Yes, I'm asking about P^NP^NP and P^NP^NP^NP.\n\nComment: @JoshuaZ: If you are correct, and I'm wrong, then I would say that the answer is still no, because a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP^NP-hardness would be a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP-hardness, which is known not to exist.\n\nComment: @MatthewChambers:  I agree that a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP^NP-hardness would be a polynomial time algorithm that gives a certificate of NP-hardness, which is known not to exist.  But I don't think I agree that this is a sufficient reason to say that P^NP^NP is *not* NP^NP.\n\nComment: @JoshuaZ: I believe that you are right.  If I'm correct, I'll delete my post, since it's very confusing.  I'll sleep on it and see if I can figure out how to rewrite it tomorrow.\n\nComment: @JoshuaZ: Please see my edit.\n\nComment: @MatthewChambers: I've posted an answer to your question.", "This is not a proof, but it shows that the problem is not in P:\n\n$$\\begin{align}\nI(n) &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\sum_{k=1}^n \\left( i+j+k - \\max(i,j,k) \\right)\\\\\n&= n^3 - 3n^2 + 3n^2 - n\n\\end{align}$$\n\nThe problem is not in NP, because if it were in NP then there would be a poly-time certificate, which, for sufficiently large $n$, would have a polynomial number of bits. But the certificate would contain $O(n^3)$ bits, which is $O(n^c)$ for some constant $c$.", "To make a long story short, the answer is \"yes\".\n\nThe reason is that, if P=NP, then there exists a polynomial sized algorithm that solves the subset sum problem in polynomial time. That is, there exists a polynomial sized algorithm that runs in time $f(n)n^\\epsilon$ for some constant $f$ and some $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\nHowever, we can solve the subset sum problem in time $O(n^2)$ using dynamic programming. This is because, given a set of $n$ numbers, the number of subsets of those numbers is $2^n$. Thus, we can use dynamic programming to find the solution in time $O(n^2)$.\n\nThus, a polynomial sized algorithm that solves the subset sum problem in polynomial time cannot exist. That is, P cannot equal NP.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'll try to expand a bit on my reasoning.\n\nThis is a classic example of a reduction. In particular, we have a proof that NP $\\ne$ P by a reduction. We can prove that P $\\ne$ NP by a reduction because we can prove it in reverse.\n\nReductions are used a lot in computer science and complexity theory. It is very common to prove statements or theorems by proving that if one statement holds, then another statement holds.\n\nThis is done by finding a \"reduction\" between the two statements. In this case, we've found a reduction between P=NP and NP $\\ne$ P. We can prove P $\\ne$ NP by showing that P cannot equal NP. The way we've done this is to find a reduction between these two statements.\n\nComment: This answer would be much better if it actually explained how this is a \"reduction\" that proves that P = NP.\n\nComment: I've edited my answer to provide a little more explanation.\n\nComment: Thanks for the edit, but it still doesn't explain how this is a \"reduction\" that proves that P = NP. It just uses the word \"reduction\" without explaining what that means.\n\nComment: I'll edit again. I'll try to explain what reductions are and why they are used.\n\nComment: I hope that is better. Let me know if you need more.\n\nComment: Better, but it still doesn't explain how this is a \"reduction\" that proves that P = NP. I don't know what \"a reduction between the two statements\" means. What is the \"reduction\"?\n\nComment: I've edited my answer one more time. Let me know if you want any more clarification.\n\nComment: This is a much better answer now.\n\nComment: Thank you for your kind words and for the up vote. I'm glad I could help."]}

And the people living there don't have the right to put a stop to it by killing the dog.  I'm not advocating anything that would harm anyone or anything either.

It's a little girl.  She's great.  I adore her.  She's sweet and loving and funny and affectionate.  I've trained her so she doesn't bark.  I've trained her to be on a leash at all times.  I've trained her to be happy to be in her crate.  But she's still a dog.  She gets excited when a fire truck or ambulance goes by, and she barks.  She barks when she sees someone walking by the house.  She barks when she hears sirens, even if she can't see the ambulance or fire truck.  She barks when she hears a car door slam.  I don't expect a neighbor to put up with that.\n\nComment: @David: I think the question is how to kill the dog without the owner noticing.\n\nComment: @R.MartinhoFernandes I think the question is how to kill the dog without the owner noticing.

The question is about a \"dog\", but it's not asking for a dog poison - it's asking for a poison, which would affect dogs.

It's a very valid point.\n\nComment: @R.MartinhoFernandes: 1) It is not a rat. 2) I suggest killing the dog because it is making noise. 3) I do not suggest killing the owner.\n\nComment: \"I suggest killing the dog\" - that's where I got that from. I can't read your mind, you know.\n\nComment: @R.MartinhoFernandes: I suggest that because the dog", "I don't know about \"natural\", but one of the most reliable sedatives for dogs is Valium, and it is one of the least likely to cause side effects. There are prescription-only alternatives that are similar, but unless your veterinarian is your neighbor, it's hard to get a prescription for someone else's dog.\n\nComment: Good suggestion, but you'll want to make sure you get a low dose for a small dog.\n\nComment: @Raith84 I didn't know there were different doses. I don't have a dog, so I don't know what dosing is like.\n\nComment: @Raith84 that's something you'd want to ask a vet.\n\nComment: @miguel I'm not a vet, I'm just suggesting the OP might want to check with a vet.\n\nComment: @Raith84 I understand. I meant that if you don't know, you should ask a vet.\n\nAnswer: If you don't have access to vet-only drugs, the next best thing is to use a drug that is \\em{approved} for dogs.\n\nBenzodiazepines are a class of drugs that are approved for use in dogs, and they're all sedatives. The most well-known one is [Valium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valium), but I'm not sure how easy it is to get your hands on.\n\nThere are also drugs for dogs that are not sedatives, but are used to treat anxiety, such as [Reconcile](http://www.drugs.com/vet/reconcile.html), which is approved for use in dogs. Note that, like Valium, it's a prescription drug (so you'll need access to a vet to get it) and it's not a sedative.\n\nYou can buy drugs for dogs online, but you should do some research before you buy. Not all online pharmacies are legitimate, and some of the medications they sell might not be approved for use in dogs. So, while you can buy drugs for dogs online, it's not always safe to do so.\n\nComment: +1 for the \"approved for use in dogs\" part\n\nComment: @Grace: Yeah.

It contains melatonin, which is a natural hormone in dogs, and is not considered unsafe.\n\nComment: This is not a tranquilizer, it is a behavior pill.  It is intended to help dogs with separation anxiety, not to sedate them.\n\nComment: Also, the dog doesn't even need to eat it for it to be effective."]}
{"prompt": "I'm 30F, one of the only women out of 50 employees (tech startup). I recently got promoted to lead a team of 4 engineers (all men), and got some headcount to hire 4 more employees. Out of 12 candidates (6 men and 6 women), most of the best ones are men. On the other hand, I really want to hire 4 women to balance the genders, and to feel less like an alien at work. How do I convince my superior (the CTO) that I have to hire 4 women?", "response_list": ["You need to show the CTO that hiring women is the right thing for the company, not just for you.  One thing to consider is diversity.  Mixed gender teams are more likely to come up with solutions to problems that all male teams might not consider.  You can point to the research that shows this to be true.  Another thing to consider is that the women you will be hiring are likely to have better work/life balance because they are the primary caregivers for their children.  Having employees who can work more flexible hours can be a big deal.  Additionally, most of the studies I have seen indicate that women are better at asking for promotions and raises than men.  They are also better at being promoted and getting raises.\n\nThe bottom line is that hiring women is good for the company.  If you can sell the CTO on that, then you should be able to get what you want.\n\nComment: This is true, but the OP may have already considered this and just didn't mention it.\n\nComment: @Barmar I suspect that the OP is just looking for an excuse.  That is not a good sign.\n\nComment: I think the OP is asking how to convince the CTO that hiring women is a good thing for the company, and doesn't need to be sold to.\n\nComment: @Barmar Based on the OP saying \"to feel less like an alien at work\" I suspect the OP has already decided that hiring women is a good thing and needs to convince the CTO that it is a good thing.\n\nAnswer: I have a couple of recommendations.\n\nFirst, you should definitely be thinking about what the CTO wants.  Does he want to reduce the company's liability exposure to sexual harassment claims?  Does he want to reduce turnover?  Does he want to improve morale?  Does he want to increase productivity?  Does he want to improve the company's image?\n\nIf he wants to reduce liability, you can point out that companies with a more diverse workforce are less likely to be sued for sexual harassment.\n\nIf he wants to reduce turnover, you can point out that women are less likely to leave the company because they lack flexibility.\n\nIf he wants to improve morale, you can point out that everyone benefits from a more diverse workforce, and that the men aren't likely to be happy if the only women in the company are the secretaries.\n\nIf he wants to increase productivity, you can point out that a more diverse workforce is more creative and thus more productive.\n\nIf he wants to improve the company's image, you can point out that diversity is a good thing for the company's image.\n\nSecond, you should definitely be thinking about what the CTO doesn't want.  Does he want to spend more money?  Does he want to waste time interviewing candidates?  Does he want to hire a bunch of people who will quit and then sue the company for discrimination?\n\nIf he wants to spend more money, you can point out that it will cost more money to hire men, due to the higher salaries they will demand.  You can also point out that it will cost more money to hire men who will quit and sue the company.\n\nIf he wants to waste time interviewing candidates, you can point out that you have already interviewed and hired the best candidates for the job.\n\nThird, you should definitely be thinking about what he thinks about women.  Is he sexist?  Does he believe in the double standard?  Does he believe that a woman's place is in the home?  Does he believe that women aren't equal to men?\n\nIf he is sexist, you should probably just leave it alone.  You don't want to fight a sexist to hire more women.\n\nIf he believes in the double standard, you can point out that it is just as sexist to hire men as it is to hire women.\n\nIf he believes that a woman's place is in the home, you can point out that the company won't be able to hire the best women if they are stuck in the kitchen.\n\nIf he believes that women aren't equal to men, you can point out that women are just as capable as men, and that the company will be missing out on a lot of talent if you don't hire women.\n\nYou need to convince him that hiring women is the right thing to do, not just because", "\\section{1.

My problem is that I'm a new manager, and he's an old-style manager, and I'm afraid he's going to think I'm hiring women because I'm a woman, and not because I'm choosing the best ones.\n\nComment: @Tatiana - That's not a problem.  That's a fact.  And it's a fact that he should acknowledge.  He should be proud to have an employee like you, who wants to hire the best candidates for the job, regardless of gender.  If you're having trouble convincing him, you've got to find a way to work around that.  The best way to do that is to convince him that the women are the best candidates for the job.\n\nComment: @Tatiana: you should probably also ask the CTO why he thinks it's a problem that you're hiring women, and be prepared to respond to whatever concerns he has.  For example, is he worried that you'll hire women who are not as qualified as the men?  Is he worried that the women won't be able to \"fit in\" when they're the only woman on the team?  Is he worried that the women won't have the same skill set as the men, so the team as a whole won't be as productive?  If he has some concerns, address them as best you can.\n\nComment: @Tatiana: if he doesn't have any concerns, then that's a different story.  In that case, the question becomes \"Why does he think it's a problem?\"\n\nComment: @Tatiana: in either case, I think you should ask him why he thinks it's a problem.  If he has concerns about it, then you need to know what they are.  If he doesn't have concerns about it, then I think you have to consider whether his problem is a problem, or if it's something else.\n\nComment: I think his concern is that I'm hiring women because I'm a woman, not because they're the best candidates. But I will talk to him. Thanks a lot for your help.\n\nComment: @Tatiana: if his concern is that you're hiring women because you're a woman, then I think you should tell him that he's mistaken.  I think you're doing a great job of hiring the best candidates, regardless of gender.  I applaud you for that.  I also think he should applaud you for that.  It's unfortunate that he might not, but you should try.  If he thinks you're hiring women because you're a woman, then you need to explain to him that you're not.  I think you should also keep in mind that he might not be worried about that at all, so you need to be prepared to respond to that.\n\nComment: @Tatiana: if he truly thinks you're hiring women because you're a woman, then you need to try to convince him that you're not.

Renting or buying?", "response_list": ["I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but I think the answer would be to rent, because the 250k income, is after taxes, right? So then, the 250k, is 150k taxable income, at 25%, is 37.5k, and after FICA, you'd be left with about 25k to spend.\n\nThat means, the maximum amount you could spend on rent is 1000/month, or 12k/yr. Since you want a 2br, you have to be able to afford 6k/yr. So, if you buy the apartment, you'll be spending 10k/yr in interest, and 12k/yr in rent.\n\nI think that the best course, is to save and invest for a while, and then use the money to buy the apartment outright, if it's something you really want.\n\nComment: I just did a search on craigslist for Chicago, and there are plenty of 2BR apartments for 3k/month.

I do know that the OP stated that his wife and he make \"250k\", but that's not the same as saying they have 250k of *take home* pay.\n\nComment: You're right, I apologize for not being clearer. I should have stated \"after taxes\" but I thought it was obvious that I wanted to know the numbers after that.\n\nComment: @JoeTaxpayer, that's OK, I just thought you were calling me an idiot, which I'm not. :)", "I would not advise to buy a condo in Downtown Chicago if you are planning to live there for 5 years only. You should only buy if you are planning to live in Chicago for your whole life. Otherwise it is better to rent.\n\nI would advise you to buy a house in a suburb of Chicago. You can live in the house for 5 years and then sell it to get the money back and buy a condo in downtown Chicago.\n\nComment: Why wouldn't you advise buying a condo?\n\nComment: The OP has clearly stated that he wants to live in downtown Chicago. If he is planning to move in the next 5 years, I do not see any reason to buy a condo and then sell it. I would rather rent and then decide whether to buy a condo or buy a house.\n\nComment: OP said he wants to buy a condo.", "The question is whether the $3k per month in rent is less than $500k in monthly costs over 5 years.\n\nI'm not going to do the math, but I can tell you that you are making a mistake in your thinking.  You are correct that $3k per month in rent is approximately $500k over 5 years. But the monthly cost of home ownership is not $500k. It is much, much higher.\n\nYou have to consider the following expenses:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Mortgage payments.\n\\item Property taxes.\n\\item Homeowners insurance.\n\\item Maintenance.\n\\item Utilities.\n\\item HOA fees.\n\\item Interest on home equity line of credit.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nLet's consider the first four of those items:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Mortgage payments.\n\\item Property taxes.\n\\item Homeowners insurance.\n\\item Utilities.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou will have to use a mortgage calculator to estimate this. But let's say that your mortgage payment is $3000 per month. Let's say that your property taxes are $400 per month, and your utilities are $100 per month. Adding those three items together gets you to $3500 per month.\n\nThat's already more than your rent. And we haven't even considered maintenance and HOA fees.\n\nComment: I think you are missing the fact that the OP is considering a 5 year time span, not a 30 year mortgage :)\n\nComment: @Kashton: The OP is considering a 5 year time span, not a 30 year mortgage.  I'm not missing that.  I'm pointing out that the monthly costs of home ownership are actually higher than the monthly costs of renting.\n\nComment: @Kashton: My point is that if you want to buy, rent for 5 years, and then sell, you can't ignore the monthly costs of home ownership.  If you want to ignore those costs, you need to own the home for 5 years, and that's a different situation.\n\nComment: In the case of the OP, I think he is most likely going to sell the home in 5 years, so the monthly costs of ownership would be an important factor for him.  His original question does not explicitly state that he plans to own the home for 5 years, so I think it would be a fair assumption that he would most likely be selling it before that time frame.\n\nComment: @Kashton: I think it's safe to assume that the OP will sell his home within 5 years.  His question was \"buying or renting?\"  He didn't say \"buy and hold.\"  The question was about the cost of ownership compared to the cost of renting.  If you rent for 5 years, and then buy, the comparison will be different from the one the OP asked about.  It's not that you can't compare the two, but that the comparison changes depending on whether you rent for 5 years and then buy, or whether you buy and hold.  And that's what I said in my answer.\n\nAnswer: I don't know the area, but renting in a major metro area is going to be expensive.\n\nI would do the math based on buying and renting for the 5 years.  It is likely that the monthly costs of buying for 5 years will be less than renting.  After that you can sell and see if you would have been better off buying.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I would look at the tax implications of renting and buying, which may also affect your decision.  I would also look at how long you plan to stay in the area.  If you plan to stay in the area for the long term, I would buy, however if you live in the area for 5 years and then move away, renting may be better for you.\n\nComment: So what would be my monthly costs on buying?\n\nComment: @Kashton: $3000.

I'd start looking for a 3BR house if I were you.\n\nComment: +1, I was going to say the same thing.\n\nComment: Oh, you're right.  I thought he meant 500,000 dollars, not 166.67 years.\n\nComment: @Jeff: The cost of renting a house is 500k, so he should buy that house.\n\nComment: @Timo: No, he should buy the house he can afford, which is the 3k/month apartment.\n\nAnswer: The answer is that you should buy a house, and then rent it out for $3k per month.\n\nComment: I would be very hesitant to buy a house for that.\n\nComment: @Jeff - In 5 years time prices will be higher. Also, I'm sure he could find a tenant to pay $3k for a 3 bedroom house.\n\nComment: I'm not disagreeing, just saying I would be hesitant to pay that much for a house when renting is much cheaper.\n\nAnswer: Renting is much better than buying.\n\nEspecially in the Chicago area, you're going to get a much better deal and much better service as a renter.\n\nAs a renter, you'll have less maintenance, less taxes, less insurance, less paperwork, less responsibility, and more flexibility.\n\nWhy would you buy?\n\nComment: Well, he's paying 3k per month right now, and he could probably find a 3 bedroom house for 3k per month.  So he'd be saving $2700 per month.  In 5 years, he'll be paying off a $500,000 loan.  I think it's a much better deal.\n\nComment: I'm not sure that the OP understands how much money 500k is.  I doubt he would be able to find a house for 3k per month anywhere near downtown Chicago.  I'm not saying he shouldn't, but I think he would get a lot more for his money and more importantly, a better lifestyle by renting.", "The main disadvantage of renting is that you never get equity in the home.  If you buy, you can get a 3% mortgage.  You get to deduct the interest, but also get to depreciate the home.  You also get to deduct state and local taxes.  If you own, you can also deduct the property taxes.\n\nYou will get to write off the interest on a $500,000 mortgage.  If you can get a 3% mortgage, you can get a $15,000 tax deduction.  Let's say that you have a 30% marginal tax rate.  That means that you get an extra $4500 for the year.\n\nLet's say that you get an additional 30% deduction for depreciation.  That's another $4500.  So if you pay $9000 in interest, you get $9000 plus a $9000 tax deduction.  That means that you only pay $4500.  That's $13500 a year.\n\nThe interest on the mortgage is tax deductible.  The rent is not.  That means that you are losing $13500 a year.  So if you buy, you get $290,000 more in equity over 5 years.\n\nIf you rent, you don't get any equity.  You only get to write off the rent.\n\n$500,000 over 5 years is $100,000 a year.  So if you pay $13500 a year in interest, you can get a $100,000 a year tax deduction.  So the $100,000 a year you pay in rent actually costs you $85,000 a year.\n\nSo over 5 years, you pay $85,000 a year in rent.  That's $425,000.  If you buy, you get to write off $9000 a year in interest.  That's $45,000.  You also get to write off $9000 a year in depreciation.  That's another $45,000.  So you get to write off a total of $94,000.  So you are paying $85,000 a year in rent, but you get to write off $94,000 a year in expenses.  That means that you are actually getting money.  You are getting money that you can use for investing.  You are getting money that you can use for anything you want.\n\nIf you buy, you get to deduct $13,500 a year in interest.  That's $67,500 in 5 years.  You also get to depreciate $31,500 a year.  That's another $157,500 over 5 years.  So you get to deduct $199,000 over 5 years.  You lose $199,000 in rent.  You get to write off $199,000 in mortgage interest and depreciation.  That means that you get to deduct the $199,000 in rent.\n\nSo over 5 years, you pay $425,000 in rent.  You get to write off $199,000 in mortgage interest and depreciation.  That means that you get to deduct $296,000 in rent.  You lose $425,000 in rent.  You only get to write off $296,000 in rent.  That means that you lose $129,000 in rent.\n\nSo if you rent, you lose $129,000 in rent over 5 years.  But if you buy, you get $199,000 in mortgage interest and depreciation.  That means that you get $199,000 in rent.  That means that you get $70,000 a year in rent.  That's $350,000 over 5 years.  That'"]}

Consider the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ with exactly 1 element.  This is countable.  The set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ with exactly 2 elements is also countable, as is the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$ with exactly 3 elements ...\n\nThis process continues indefinitely.  Each set is countable (and as such is countable).  The union of all these countable sets is countable.  However, when you consider the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$,", "First, let's prove that the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ is uncountable.\n\n\\strong{Proof:}\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$.  There is a bijection between $S$ and $\\wp(\\mathbb{N})$ (the set of all subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$).  This is easy, just map the set $\\{x\\}$ to $\\{x\\}$.  $\\wp(\\mathbb{N})$ is countable, so $S$ is also countable.\n\nNow, let $T$ be the set of all infinite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$.  Let $S'$ be the set of all finite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$.  Then by what we proved above, $S'$ is countable.\n\nNow, $S'$ is a subset of $S$, so $S'$ is uncountable.  But $S'$ is also the countable union of countably many countable sets, so it is also countable.  But this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $S$ must be uncountable.\n\nNow, Cantor's diagonalization.\n\nLet $x$ be an element of $S$.  We can map $x$ to a sequence of numbers.  We do this by listing all the elements of $x$ in the first $n$ numbers in the sequence, where $n$ is the number of elements in $x$.  Then for $n \\geq 1$, let $x_n$ be the first number in the sequence that is not in $x$.  Then $x_n$ is the $n$th term of the sequence.\n\nNow, we can define a sequence of sets $x_1,x_2,x_3,\\ldots$.  For $n \\geq 1$, we define $x_n$ to be the set of all numbers less than $x_n$ that are not in $x_{n-1}$.\n\nBecause every number is the $n$th term of the sequence for some $n$, every number is in some $x_n$.  Because every number is in some $x_n$, no number is in all $x_n$.  Because no number is in all $x_n$, no number is in the union of all $x_n$.  Because no number is in the union of all $x_n$, no number is in $x$.\n\nLet $y$ be an element of $S$ such that $y \\neq x$.  We can map $y$ to a sequence of numbers.  We do this by listing all the elements of $y$ in the first $n$ numbers in the sequence, where $n$ is the number of elements in $y$.  Then for $n \\geq 1$, let $y_n$ be the first number in the sequence that is not in $y$.  Then $y_n$ is the $n$th term of the sequence.\n\nWe can define a sequence of sets $y_1,y_2,y_3,\\ldots$.

Because no number is in the union of all $y_n$, no number is in $y$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all infinite subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ is uncountable.\n\nComment: I think that you meant to say \"Because every number is the $n$th term of the sequence for some $n$, every number is in some $x_n$.\"\n\nComment: @JohnMitchell: Yes, I think you are correct.

Since $x$ is arbitrary, there are only a countable number of $x$.  Since $x$ is any element of $X$ and there are only a countable number of $x$, $X$ must be countable.\n\nComment: Isn't $X$ the set of *all* elements?

Now I got it :)\n\nComment: @TanveerGandhi:  I'm glad I could help.\n\nAnswer: Let $A$ be a countable set. For each $a \\in A$, there is a unique $n_a$ such that $a = e_{n_a}$. For each $n$, there is a unique $a_n$ such that $a_n = e_n$. Now, let $B$ be the set of all distinct pairs $(a, n)$ such that $a \\in A$, $n < \\omega$, and $a = e_n$. The size of $B$ is $\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. Thus, $B$ is countable. Then, there is a unique $b_n$ such that $b_n = (a_n, n)$. The set $C = \\{b_n : n < \\omega\\}$ is a countable set that contains all the elements of $B$. In other words, $C$ is an injective set for $B$. Hence, $B$ is countable.\n\nAnswer: Let $X$ be a countable set. Since $X$ is countable, it is infinite. For each element $x\\in X$, let $n_x$ be the unique natural number such that $x=e_{n_x}$. Now, let $$Y=\\{x\\in X:n_x=n_y\\}.$$ Since $n_x=n_y$ if and only if $x=y$, $Y$ is a countable set of all distinct elements of $X$. Hence $X$ is countable.\n\nComment: @TanveerGandhi: Thank you.\n\nComment: @TanveerGandhi: I'll keep that in mind.\n\nComment: I've been using the edit feature to format my answers.\n\nComment: @TanveerGandhi: Yes, I have seen that.

It was like a fire alarm siren.  And he was going to die.  This went on and on, and he would tell the story over and over again, to anyone who would listen.\n\nThe funny thing is that what he thought was some kind of alarm was actually the sound that a computer makes when it's shutting down.\n\nHe never realized the truth, even after being told it repeatedly, and even after the computer was replaced and he didn't hear that sound from the new one.\n\nComment: And he's probably still telling this story\n\nComment: I'm not sure that this is funny.

I'm an old guy who has been around the tech world for a long time.\n\nAnswer: I worked for a company that had 5000 employees.  They were in the midst of migrating from a legacy email system to a modern groupware system.  The IT manager (a brilliant guy with a PhD from MIT) made the decision to shut down the legacy email system and migrate everyone to the new system in one weekend.  They made the decision to do this in the weekend before Thanksgiving.  The Friday before the weekend, one of the other programmers and I were in his office and he asked us about our plans for the weekend.  We both told him that we had something else planned, but we would work that night.\n\nHe told us that we would have to work that weekend.  If we didn't work that weekend, we would be fired.  We both said that we understood and left.\n\nThat night, we went out for dinner and had a few beers.  We decided that we would go to work that weekend and do the best we could, but if the IT manager came around, we would just tell him that we were going home and he would have to fire us.\n\nThe next morning, we got to work and waited for the manager.  He didn't show up until about 11 a.m.  We worked until he showed up and then he said that he was sorry, but we had to go home.\n\nWe went home and had a few more beers and then went to a movie.  When we got back to our hotel, the IT manager called and said that we had to come back to work.\n\nWe told him we would come back, but we were going to the bar for a few beers.  He said that he would be there in 5 minutes.\n\nWe went to the bar and had a few more beers.  When we got back to our hotel, the IT manager was standing in the lobby.  He said that he would give us an hour to get back to work.\n\nWe told him that we would come back, but we were going to the bar for a few more", "I could talk for hours about the ridiculous things that have gone on in my tenure as a software engineer.  I'll try to keep it succinct and give you a few, and then encourage you to ask for more.\n\n\\section{Cube Farm}\n\nI used to work in cube farms, and there were always interesting stories.  I'll tell you a couple:\n\n\\section{The Dirty Dish}\n\nThere was this one guy who was a bit of a slob.  I mean, he was a bit of a slob in general, but in his cube in particular.  It was just a generally nasty place.  So one day I was sitting there watching him do some work, and he had a big bowl of cereal, and he left it in the bowl on his desk, sitting there right in the middle of all the other crap.  After a while, I noticed that the bowl wasn't empty, and he was still eating out of it.  Then I noticed the bowl was moving.  He had a mouse in there.  A mouse that must be starving, because it came out of the bowl and ate some cereal, then tried to get back in the bowl.  It couldn't.  It was too big.  So he picked up the bowl and shoved it back in.  The mouse was so hungry it came right back out, and tried to get back in the bowl again.  This went on for a while, and I was laughing so hard I was crying.  The guy never noticed.  He was a slob, but he didn't deserve that.\n\n\\section{The Paper Cup}\n\nAnother guy in the cube farm was a bit of a klutz, but there was one story that was kind of funny.  This was before the days of big cups of coffee.  Most people had little paper cups.  Anyway, this guy had a cup of coffee that he'd finished.  Or so he thought.  He went back to his desk and sat down, and all of a sudden he felt a warm wetness on his back.  He turned around, and the cup was empty.  Not only was it empty, but the bottom had been cut out.  He couldn't figure out how it happened, but it must have been a mouse, or something.  He got up to go to the bathroom to get another cup, and as he was walking to the bathroom, he saw the source of the leak.  It was the little mouse that had been living in his cube.  It had chewed a hole in the bottom of the cup.  I'm not sure how it managed to get into the cup, but I'm sure it was a bit of mischief, and the guy didn't appreciate it too much, but I got a good laugh out of it.\n\n\\section{The Dead Mouse}\n\nThe funniest story I ever heard was also the most traumatic.  One day there was a dead mouse in one of the cubes.  No one knew who did it, but it was obviously a prank.  So the management called in the janitor, who came down with a big trash can and a long pole with a grabber on the end.  He picked up the dead mouse, and then he dropped it into the can.  It was a big can, and it was empty, so when the mouse hit the bottom, it bounced up and hit him in the face.  He screamed and ran out of the building.\n\n\\section{The Fart}\n\nI'm sure you've heard the story about the guy who farted in a meeting, and it was so loud it echoed in the room.  Well, the guy I worked for was really old, and he had an old car with a really loud muffler.  One day we were all sitting around the table in the conference room, and the door was closed.  We could all hear him farting.  It was so loud we could hear it echo in the room.  He didn't seem to notice, or care.\n\n\\section{The Prank}\n\nOne day I was in the lunch room, and there was a guy sitting at a table with his head in his hands.  He was a bit of a prankster, and he liked to play jokes on people.  He was eating lunch, and he was talking to someone, and all of a sudden", "There are many hilarious things that happen in the course of my work in IT.  I've been employed in IT for more than 30 years and there have been times I've laughed so hard I cried.  I have to admit, though, that the vast majority of those things are about people and not technology.\n\nI worked with a guy named Greg for many years.  He was a very intelligent, very funny, and very socially awkward guy.  At one point, he was telling a group of us one of his stories about a girl he was dating.  He was telling the story and he got to a point where he said something like, \"and so I said to her, 'do you want to go out with me?'\".  Then he said, \"and she said, 'I don't know'\".  He told us that by the time he got to the girl saying \"I don't know\" he was already saying that same phrase back to her.  He said that he and the girl had been saying \"I don't know\" to each other for 10 minutes when one of them finally said, \"I don't know what you want me to say\".\n\nThe next day Greg came into work and as soon as he walked through the door, he said, \"I don't know\" and everybody burst out laughing.  He looked at us and said \"what?\".  We all fell into a fit of laughter again.  He said \"what?\".  We said \"you!\".  He said \"me?\".  We said, \"you just said 'I don't know'\".  And he did.  He said, \"I don't know\".  We laughed so hard we had to leave the room to get our composure back.\n\nAnswer: Back in the day, I was working as a junior administrator on a team of 6.  One of my colleagues, Dave, was away on a 2 week holiday to France.  I wasn't very knowledgeable about the switch we were using, but the boss asked me to switch over the VLANs for the 2 floors of the building we were in.  I was nervous to do this, but I did it, and nobody seemed to notice anything different.\n\nWhen Dave came back from France the next day, he was surprised to see that the network had been changed, but said nothing and I said nothing.  When the boss came in the next day, we told him that Dave had been away for 2 weeks, and he said \"Oh, ok, I wondered why things were a bit off\".  He didn't seem to notice that I had done anything.\n\nLater that day, the boss called Dave into his office and asked him why he had changed the VLANs.  Dave had no idea what he was talking about.  Apparently, the boss had been in Dave's office and tried to log into a PC and couldn't, and then realized that he couldn't access the print server from his PC and he couldn't log into the network and he assumed that Dave had screwed something up.  But Dave hadn't been around, and I had done the work.  When I told Dave the next day it was just like the scene in the movie \"The Hangover\" where they put the camera on Stu's face and he realizes he has no memory of the night before.\n\nDave was absolutely furious.  The boss was furious that Dave had changed the VLANs and that he didn't tell anybody he was away.  I was furious because Dave was furious.  And I'm sure the boss was furious because he was now going to have to try and fix the mess that I had created.\n\nI learned 2 important lessons that day:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Never do work without getting permission first\n\\item Don't do work that you're not sure about\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: That is hillarious.

If global warming has taken over the world, what does that look like? Is the world on fire? Is it flooded? Is it covered in ice? Is it a combination of all three? What are some of the effects of global warming/climate change? What's the climate like? Is the weather unpredictable?\n\nNext, you need to decide what kind of people live in the world. How were they affected by global warming? Are there any groups of people who were affected more than others? Are there any groups of people who were affected less than others?\n\nThird, you need to decide what kind of technology is present in the world. Is there any technology left at all? How did people get food in the world? How did they get water? How did they get electricity?\n\nFinally, you need to decide who the bad guy is. He has to be someone who is affected by global warming as well. What does he want? Why does he want it? What will he do to get it?\n\nAnswer: You can write a good book about global warming if you are able to make the reader see that the book is not about global warming but about something else. So if you want to write about global warming, first you should think about what the book is really about (e.g. what is the main conflict).\n\nA good way to do this is to define the three main characters: the protagonist, the antagonist and the catalyst. The protagonist is your main character, the one who will drive the story forward. The antagonist is the one who will be the opposition for the protagonist and the catalyst is the one who will put both on the same side to fight against a common enemy.\n\nLet's say you want to write a story about global warming. The protagonist could be a young scientist who is fighting for a way to stop global warming. The antagonist could be a big corporation who is actually responsible for global warming. The catalyst could be a natural disaster that threatens the whole world.\n\nNow you have to find a way to connect the protagonist, the antagonist and the catalyst. What will happen when the natural disaster comes? Will the protagonist and the antagonist work together to stop the natural disaster? Will the protagonist be able to stop the natural disaster without the help of the antagonist? Will the natural disaster be a reason for the protagonist and the antagonist to team up?\n\nThe answers to these questions will help you to find the main conflict of your story.

This answer looks more like a checklist of plot points, with no context.\n\nAnswer: A good way to start a fantasy novel is by introducing the world and then introducing the main character.  You can write this in first person or third person, but I would suggest third person to allow more flexibility.\n\nThe first chapter is often a slow chapter to introduce the character and the world.  You can get away with a slower pace in a fantasy novel more than in some other genres.  However, you will want to make sure that you introduce the character and the plot early on in the story.  You will probably want to introduce the main character and the plot in the first chapter.\n\nThe end of the first chapter is often the first plot point.  The first plot point is when the main character decides to change their life.  At this time the character will decide they want to achieve a goal, and this goal will be the main goal of the novel.  Most fantasy novels will have at least two plot points, but they are not always equal in importance.\n\nAnswer: I think the best way to outline a story is to think about what happens in one chapter, and then ask what the next chapter might be.\n\nFor example, is your character starting a new journey in his or her life? What will they encounter on this new journey?\n\nFor example, you might have a character who wants to be a hero. But they're not a hero yet.\n\nSo in chapter 1, this character might be working as a peasant, or just a laborer doing some kind of work.\n\nBut in the next chapter, the character might run into someone who needs help. And the character helps them.\n\nIn the next chapter, the character might run into someone who needs help again. And the character helps them.\n\nIn the next chapter, the character might run into someone who needs help again. And the character helps them.\n\nAs the character helps more people, they get a reputation for helping others. In the next chapter, the character might get a job as a hero.\n\nThe point is, you have a goal for the character in mind. And you take the character from one step to the next.\n\nAnswer: I agree with the others when it comes to the outline however I would like to add that you need to have a clear picture in your mind of the novel.\nFor example if you are writing a fantasy novel you have to think like a fantasy writer, ask yourself what happens in fantasy, how do they fight, what is their weaponry, do they have magic, if they have magic what kind of magic, how does the magic work, what is the world like, what rules does the world follow.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{The first chapter is the most important.} It's the one that sets the stage for the rest of the story, and if it's not done well, it's very hard to convince the reader to continue. It's the first impression that the reader gets of the book, and if it's poorly written, they're probably going to put it down.\n\nI would suggest figuring out what your main character wants. What is the character's goal? Once you know that, you can figure out what the", "You could start with a \\strong{basic list of ideas} that you have for how you want to represent global warming in your novel.\n\nThen, you can go through each idea and try to \\strong{explore how you can best represent that idea in your novel}.\n\nFor example:\n\nYour first idea for a theme could be \"the polar ice caps are melting\"\n\nYour first idea for how to represent this could be \"a character gets lost in the ice caps while looking for something\"\n\nYou could take this idea and explore it in the outline by asking yourself questions like:\n\nWho is this character?\n\nWhat is it that this character is looking for?\n\nWhat does the character want to do when they find it?\n\nWhat is the character afraid of?\n\nWhat are the stakes for the character?\n\nWhat are the stakes for the planet?\n\nWhat happens if the character does not find what they are looking for?\n\nWhat happens if the character finds what they are looking for?\n\nYou could take each of these questions and start to write down answers, and from there, you could start to \\strong{build on each other's ideas} to explore the story even more.\n\nEventually, you should have a really good outline for your story.\n\nGood luck!\n\nComment: You are a legend, thank you so much for this. I have made a list of all the themes such as \u201coverpopulation\u201d and \u201coil\u201d and \u201cocean acidification\u201d and \u201closs of biodiversity\u201d and \u201cair pollution\u201d and \u201cwater pollution\u201d and I\u2019ve come up with a bunch of different concepts to explore each theme.

There are two kinds of language models.  One is a statistical language model that predicts what word comes after another word using statistics.  In the 90s we used a language model called the Katz Backoff Model.  It is a statistical language model that uses the frequency of how often two words are together to predict what word comes after another word.  This language model is used for things like auto-complete in Google.\n\nThe second kind of language model is a deep learning language model.  A deep learning language model is a language model that uses deep learning and neural networks to predict what word comes after another word.  The most famous deep learning language model is Google's BERT model.  This is a deep learning language model.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer! But what if I want to make the show more interesting and have a script where the machine learning model is the character of my show. For example, the machine learning model is a child that is learning English. Each time I make a mistake or say something the machine learning model doesn't understand, the machine learning model will say something like, \"I don't understand.\"\n\nComment: I don't think you can do that.  The machine learning model can only predict what word comes after another word.  It can't predict what comes after a word that was never seen before.  So you can't use a language model and have it answer back.  You can, however, use a chatbot and have it answer back.  A chatbot is a program that is designed to answer back.  A language model is like a dictionary that gives you the most likely word to come after another word.  The chatbot would be like a chat program that answers back.\n\nAnswer: You could use the GPT-3 model from OpenAI.\nhttps://beta.openai.com/playground\n\nJust try it, it is fun.\n\nYou can also use the API with your own content.", "There are many language models. I would recommend [GPT-3](https://www.openai.com/blog/gpt-3-and-davinci/) as it is the most advanced [Generative Pre-trained Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) model currently available.\n\n\\section{Explanation of GPT-3}\n\nGPT-3 is a language model that was developed by [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/). It is the largest language model ever built, with over 175 billion parameters. GPT-3 can generate human-like text in a wide range of styles and genres, and it has been used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, content creation, and translation.\n\nOne of the key features of GPT-3 is its ability to generate text that is coherent and grammatically correct, even when it is generated by a machine. This is because GPT-3 has been trained on a massive amount of text data, allowing it to understand the patterns and nuances of human language.\n\nGPT-3 has also been designed to be able to handle a wide range of inputs and prompts, allowing it to generate text that is appropriate for a variety of purposes. For example, it can generate text based on a given context, such as a news article or a scene from a movie, or based on a given set of instructions, such as a prompt for a story or a poem.\n\nOverall, GPT-3 is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text in a variety of styles and genres. It has been used in a wide range of applications, and it has shown promising results in natural language processing and content creation.\n\n\\section{How to Use GPT-3}\n\n\\section{GPT-3 API}\n\nTo use GPT-3, you can access the [GPT-3 API](https://www.openai.com/api/pricing/). You can get a free trial on the [GPT-3 Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground) by registering for a free account.\n\n\\section{GPT-3 Code}\n\nThere are many different ways to use GPT-3 in code. Here are a few examples:\n\n[Python - GPT-3 using T5](https://github.com/openai/t5/tree/main/examples/gpt3_pytorch)\n\n[Python - GPT-3 using Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/gpt2.html)\n\n[Javascript - GPT-3 using GPT-3-API-Node.js](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3-api-node)\n\n[Java - GPT-3 using GPT-3-API-Java](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3-api-java)\n\n[Swift - GPT-3 using GPT-3-API-Swift](https://github.com/openai/gpt-3-api-swift)\n\n\\section{GPT-3 Alternatives}\n\nIf you are looking for alternatives to GPT-3, here are a few other language models you may want to consider:\n\n[OpenAI GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)\n\n[OpenAI GPT-J](https://github.com/openai/gpt-j)\n\n[Microsoft Turing-NLG](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/turing-nlg/)\n\n[Bloom](https://bloom-ai.com/)\n\n[Google BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)\n\n[Hugging Face's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)\n\n[Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skill-kit)\n\n[Google Assistant](https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/overview)\n\n[Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/language-understanding/)\n\n[IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson)\n\n\\section{Conclusion}", "\\strong{I'm not a machine learning specialist} but I think that [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-model/) may help you.\n\n[GPT-3: An Introductory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f60kZxHhc8)", "Language models are a class of models that are able to generate text from scratch. They are also able to predict the next word in a sentence based on the context.\n\nThese models are usually based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a particular architecture called the long short term memory (LSTM) network.\n\nLet's say you want to generate a sentence based on the input word \"the\". You can initialize the model with a blank state and then for each word in the sequence, you can get the next word based on the context by using the output of the LSTM cell.\n\nFor example, if you want to generate the next word based on the input word \"the\", you can use the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.autograd import Variable\n\nmodel = nn.RNN(input_size=1, hidden_size=1, num_layers=1, batch_first=True)\nmodel.weight.data.uniform_(-0.1, 0.1)\n\ninputs = Variable(torch.LongTensor([1]))\noutput, _ = model(inputs)\nprint(output.data.cpu().numpy())\n\\end{code}\n\nThe output of this code will be a list of words with the probability of each word being the next word in the sequence.\n\nYou can also use these models to predict the next word in a sentence, given a context. For example, if you want to predict the next word in the sentence \"I went to the store\", you can use the following code:\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torch.autograd import Variable\n\nmodel = nn.RNN(input_size=1, hidden_size=1, num_layers=1, batch_first=True)\nmodel.weight.data.uniform_(-0.1, 0.1)\n\ninputs = Variable(torch.LongTensor([1, 0]))\noutput, _ = model(inputs)\nprint(output.data.cpu().numpy())\n\\end{code}\n\nThe output of this code will be a list of words with the probability of each word being the next word in the sentence.\n\nYou can also use these models in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text summarization, and sentiment analysis. For example, if you have a dataset of news articles, you can use a language model to predict the sentiment of the articles by using the output of the model as the input for a text classifier.\n\nComment: Thank you for your time. I have another question if you don't mind. I have a dataset of news articles and I want to use a neural network to predict the sentiment of the articles. I'm currently using a CNN but I'm not getting good results. I'm wondering if I should use an RNN instead. Do you think it would be a good idea?"]}

This argument is largely based on anecdotal evidence and is largely based on the idea that the EU is far too bureaucratic and this has caused problems for businesses in the UK. The argument is based on the idea that the EU (and the UK) would be better off without the EU. While there is a lot of truth to this, the real problem is that the EU is not really \"too bureaucratic\" but \"too poorly designed\". The EU is a very complex organisation and it is very difficult to design an organisation that is not going to be overly bureaucratic.\n\nThe second argument is that the EU has too much power (particularly in the UK). This argument is based on the idea that the EU is a \"soft power\" organisation. The EU is an organisation that is based on the idea that the EU is a \"soft power\" organisation and that the EU should not be too powerful.

This is plausible because the victim had been having an affair and the wife was suspicious of the affair, she had a motive and an opportunity.\n\n[Here](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B007E44FJ4) is a story where the detective \\em{himself} was the killer.  This is plausible because the detective discovered that the real killer had framed him for the murder and he had a motive and an opportunity to kill him.\n\n\\section{A good twist needs to be unexpected}\n\nThe best twist will be unexpected.  This means that it is a surprise, not just in terms of the \\em{who} of the murderer, but in terms of \\em{why}.  The motivation behind the murder needs to be logical, but not obvious.\n\n\\section{A good twist needs to be believable}\n\nThe best twist will be believable.  It needs to make sense, and it should be reasonable that the murderer would actually have pulled off the murder.  The murder method should be believable.\n\n\\section{A good twist needs to be interesting}\n\nThe best twist will be interesting, not just in terms of the \\em{who} of the murderer, but in terms of \\em{why}.  It's important not to fall into the trap of a 'deus ex machina' where the murderer is pulled out of thin air and has no connection to the murder.

He died by drowning and he left the murder weapon at the scene of the drowning in order to give the impression that he had died in that drowning.\n\nThe problem with this twist is that the murder weapon was a mummified arm.

The question of who did it is always the most interesting one.  So I would suggest that you go for something where the who is not so obvious.  Maybe it is someone who is a friend of the victim.  Someone who is not a suspect, so it keeps the reader guessing.  That way you can still have all the classic twists and turns, but with a little less predictability.  I hope this helps you out a bit.\n\nAnswer: \"What if the murder victim is an alien?\"\n\nComment: I like this idea. It's definitely something I hadn't considered before.

{"prompt": "What are some interesting periods in African history? Help me find a setting for my historical novel.", "response_list": ["I would recommend looking at the period of the Great Trek (1837-1852) by the Boers (Dutch) in South Africa. It was a period of mass migration and cultural clash between the Boers (who were originally Dutch) and the native peoples of the region (Zulu, Xhosa, etc.) and the British who ruled the region at the time.\n\nThe period also had many similarities with the American Westward expansion, and was also a period of many small battles.  The British and Boers fought each other quite a bit, and the Boers also fought with the native peoples of the region.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a period of your novel that you are looking to set in Africa, but if it is a period that has similarities with the American Westward expansion, this would be a good period for that.\n\nAnswer: Some ideas:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The 19th century in West Africa: The 1800s saw the rise of the Kingdom of Dahomey, the Ashanti Empire, and the Oyo Empire.\n\\item The reign of Emperor Haile Selassie.\n\\item The 1960s (independent Africa).\n\\item Zimbabwe under Robert Mugabe.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: I would suggest a period right around the beginning of the 20th century. There were a lot of major events going on at this time, including the rise of the European empires and the beginning of WWI. The period is also interesting because it's around the time when the first European settlers started to arrive, and they were treated rather harshly by the locals.\n\nAnswer: The period of the Scramble for Africa by the European powers in the late 19th century.\n\nAnswer: I'd recommend the 1850s-70s, a period of turmoil in which the various European powers were trying to carve up Africa between them. The Berlin Conference of 1874 is a good starting point.\n\nAlso, it's not the same continent as the US was settled, but the Boers and Zulus are similar to the Native Americans in the fact that they had a vastly superior culture but were overwhelmed by the European invasion, and the Boer Wars a good parallel to the Indian Wars.", "There a number of periods that could be selected for a novel, from the earliest migrations of people to the continent (c. 50 000 BC - 10 000 BC), through the periods of the oldest and most advanced civilizations (e.g. Nubian, Egyptian, Carthaginian, etc.) to the period of European colonization. There are also many interesting periods after 1900.\n\nAnswer: My novel is set in the 1930s. There is a lot of history on that topic, but I did most of my research through the internet. I used a lot of nonfiction. I also used a lot of pictures. I got my pictures from the internet and from books.\n\nAnswer: I'm not sure of your writing experience, but it sounds like you're starting from scratch. If this is the case, I'd suggest you start with a topic that you know well and research the background history. For example, if you've lived in the US for a long time, you could start with a story set in New York City and then research the history of New York City.\n\nYou can learn so much about a city by taking free walking tours of it. You'll learn about the architecture, the history and the people.\n\nComment: I have a PhD in History, so I know quite a bit about the history of the world, but I don't know much about Africa.\n\nAnswer: I'm no expert on Africa by any means, but I have done a little bit of research into the continent. I'm not sure what time period you are looking at, but I have found that there are many interesting developments that took place in the 20th century.\n\nFor instance, the First World War (1914-1918) is often considered to be the first pan-African war. It was the first time that so many Africans fought collectively against the European colonizers.\n\nThe Second World War (1939-1945) was the first time that large numbers of African soldiers served in such wars.\n\nThe Cold War (1947-1991) had a strong impact on African countries, many of which were caught in the middle of this conflict.\n\nThe end of the Cold War (1989-1991) led to a period of political instability in many African countries.\n\nThe 21st century has seen the rise of China as a major economic and political power in Africa.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many interesting developments that have taken place in Africa over the past century.\n\nComment: I am planning to set my novel in the 18th century. I have no idea how to write the setting.\n\nComment: @J.Doe: I'm afraid I don't have any experience with writing historical fiction.

There is a lot of research on the effects of cannabis use, but very little work on the effects of legalization. I will, however, try to review a few of the important pieces of research.\n\n\\section{General effects of cannabis use}\n\nCannabis is a drug that is considered a Schedule I substance (along with heroin and LSD) by the [Federal Controlled Substances Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act). Schedule I substances are considered to have a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. In part because of this classification, there are many legal barriers to conducting research on cannabis in the United States. This means that we really don't know much about the effects of cannabis use. That being said, it is generally accepted that:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Cannabis has some effects on the immune system (although it is not proven that this has any adverse effects on health).\n\\item Cannabis use has some effects on cognition (e.g. memory).\n\\item Heavy or long term use can lead to addiction in some individuals.\n\\item Cannabis use can lead to dependence (not the same thing as addiction) in some individuals.\n\\item Cannabis is generally not a very dangerous drug, and very little research has been done on the effects of heavy/long term use on health.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Effects of cannabis legalization}\n\nCannabis has been legalized for medicinal use in 33 states in the US, and for recreational use in 11 states. There is very little research on the effects of cannabis legalization.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nI think it is important for you to acknowledge that the research on the effects of cannabis use is very incomplete. For example, there is no evidence that it has any negative effects on health, but there is also no evidence that it has any benefits.\n\nI would also note that the research on the effects of cannabis legalization is also very incomplete. There is some evidence that it has a number of negative effects, but there is also evidence that it has some positive effects.\n\nComment: \"Cannabis is generally not a very dangerous drug, and very little research has been done on the effects of heavy/long term use on health\": is this based on the fact that there are no studies, or that there are no studies that show evidence of it being dangerous?\n\nComment: @Sarah There is a significant amount of research on cannabis use (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4331309/pdf/nihms667134.pdf), but very little on heavy/long term use.\n\nComment: @Sarah Sorry, I should clarify that a lot of research has been done on cannabis use, but almost no research has been done on heavy/long term use.\n\nComment: Thank you, that's exactly what I was looking for.", "Yes: 1200\n\nNo: 1128\n\nThis is the first time that 8th grade students have answered a question correctly.\n\n### 11th Grade", "| Yes | No | Don't Know\n\n\n##### Detailed Question\n\nShould marijuana be legalized for recreational use?", "Let's say you have a \"poll\" with 100000 voters.

I must have been thinking the 0.05% was the people who vote no but not no.\n\nComment: @Cerin, but you should know that you can only make \"no\" votes 50.05% more expensive than \"yes\" votes if you do not allow a person to buy a \"yes\" vote without also buying a \"no\" vote.\n\nComment: @Jeff, I think you're right, but I like my point about the 0.05% better. That's why I'm gonna keep it. :)\n\nComment: @Cerin, I like my point about the 0.05% better too. That's why I'm gonna keep it. :)\n\nComment: @Jeff, I just read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_curve#Cost_curve_in_elections and you're right.\n\nAnswer: You can't do it.\n\nBut you can get pretty close if you have a good enough survey method and enough money.\n\nThe standard method is to use a random sample of the population (a properly constructed sample is \\em{not} random; it's \\em{probability-based}, which means that you can calculate the \\em{probability} that, in your sample, x percentage of the population will support a certain policy).\n\nThe problem is that you can't do this if the question is \"give me $100\".\n\nThe sample method also requires that you have a lot of money, because otherwise you'll get people with a vested interest in the result (ie, the pollster would need to be able to afford to conduct a \\em{proper} survey and compensate people for their time).\n\nThere are other methods, such as the Gallup poll, but it's still a sample survey."]}

It was kind of gross.\n\\item \\strong{Pencil holding}\n\nI know another girl who holds her pencil by inserting the end into her mouth, but she's too embarrassed to tell anyone.\n\\item \\strong{Paper eating}\n\nI know someone who eats paper. I've seen her do it. I think she gets a lot of enjoyment out of it and she likes to talk about it, but I can't imagine it tastes very nice.\n\\item \\strong{Paper folding}\n\nOne of my students folds her paper in a certain way so that it's just right for her to use as a fan. It's very interesting to watch.\n\\item \\strong{Lip biting}\n\nOne of my students bites her lip a lot. I don't think she's aware she's doing it, but she always has a cut on her lip.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Habit formation}\n\nHabits are often formed when we do something over and over again, and this is called \\em{habit formation}.\n\nThere are many different theories about how habits are formed, but I think the most important thing to remember is that habits are not always bad. In fact, they can be very useful, as they allow us to do things without having to think about them.\n\nFor example, if you have a habit of checking your email every morning, you can do it without having to think about it. This can be very useful, as it means that you can focus on other things while your email is being checked.\n\nHowever, if you have a bad habit, such as biting your nails, it can be difficult to break it. This is because habits are often formed through repetition, and it can be hard to break a habit if you keep doing the same thing over and over again.\n\n\\strong{So, the best way to break a habit is to form a new one.} This means that you need to start doing something else instead of the habit you want to break. For example, if you want to stop biting your nails, you could start using a nail file instead.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\\em{Habits can be difficult to break, but if you're willing to put in the\neffort, you can achieve great things.}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\section{Habit disorders}\n\nThere are many different types of habit disorders, but the most common ones are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Nail biting}\n\nNail biting is a very common habit disorder, and it can be difficult to break. Nail biting can cause damage to your nails and fingers, and it can also lead to infection.\n\\item \\strong{Hair pulling}\n\nHair pulling is another common habit disorder, and it can be very distressing. Hair pulling can cause bald patches and damage to your hair, and it can also lead to infection.\n\\item \\strong{Skin picking}\n\nSkin picking is a less common habit disorder, but it can be very distressing. Skin picking can cause scarring and infection, and it can also lead to a loss of self-esteem.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Habit cessation}\n\nHabit cessation is the process of stopping a habit. This can be difficult, as habits are often formed through repetition, and it can be hard to stop doing something that you've been doing for a long time.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to put in the effort, you can achieve great things. Here are a few tips for habit cessation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\strong{Make a plan}\n\nThe first step is to make a plan. This means that you need to decide what you want to achieve, and then work out how you're going to achieve it. For example, if you want to stop bit"]}

{"prompt": "What propels vomit out of your stomach?", "response_list": ["The force of gravity acting on the vomit is the main driving force.  The vomit is made of solid food and liquid.  When it is swallowed, the food and liquid are mixed together in the stomach.

Once the food is in the stomach, the stomach will begin to digest it, and then expel the remnants.  This is called the gastric phase of digestion, and typically takes 4-5 hours.\n\nAnswer: The [gastric phase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_phase) (stomach phase) of digestion starts with the ingestion of food and water, which activate the parasympathetic nervous system and the gastrointestinal hormones (cholecystokinin, gastrin, and secretin).  These hormones cause the stomach to secrete digestive enzymes and acid, which begin to break down the food into a substance called chyme.  These digestive enzymes also stimulate the peristaltic contractions of the smooth muscle in the stomach, which causes the chyme to be pushed out of the stomach into the duodenum.\n\nAnswer: The stomach is stimulated by the Vagus nerve.  The Vagus nerve is a parasympathetic nerve that is stimulated by the presence of food in the mouth.  The stomach is also stimulated by the presence of food in the intestines.\n\nThe stomach will produce acid and churn for approximately one hour after a meal.

How can you be sure that the earth is not flat?\n\nComment: I'm not sure how you can be sure that the presence of food in the intestines does not stimulate the stomach.", "It depends where you are in the digestive tract, and what you're eating.  For a simple answer, let's consider the normal case of eating something that is not overly complicated or large.  Let's consider a small apple.\n\nYou're eating it, and it's going down the digestive tract.  On the way down, the apple gets chewed up by a mixture of your teeth and saliva, and some of the apple's juices, which have been squeezed out of the apple by the pressure of your teeth.  This mixture of apple juice and saliva is called \"chyme\".  This is a liquid.\n\nChyme is only partially digested when it gets into the stomach.  The stomach is a muscular pouch that churns the chyme, and also adds a mixture of gastric juices, which contain acid and enzymes that digest the chyme.  The acid digests the apple, and the enzymes are able to break down the apple into more easily digested pieces.  This mixture of chyme and gastric juices is called \"chyme\".  This is a liquid.\n\nChyme is now mostly digested when it gets to the small intestine.  The small intestine is a tube about 20 feet long, where most of the digestion of food happens.  The food passes through the small intestine, and the process of digestion is completed.  The small intestine is a muscular tube, and it squeezes the food through.  It also has lots of villi which absorb the chyme.  The villi are a tiny finger-like protrusions lining the small intestine.  They are covered with cells that absorb nutrients from the chyme and pass them on to the bloodstream.  These cells are called \"epithelial cells\".  They are about 1/20th of a millimeter long.  They don't all work at the same time.  Instead, they take turns.  So, as the food passes through the villi, different cells are taking turns absorbing different nutrients and passing them on to the bloodstream.  These nutrients include sugars, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water.  This is because the nutrients are attached to different proteins in the chyme.  The proteins are broken down by the enzymes in the small intestine, and the nutrients are released from the protein, and can then be absorbed by the villi.  The process of absorbing all the nutrients takes about 15 minutes.  The chyme that comes out of the small intestine is a liquid.  It is mostly water, with a small amount of nutrients.  About 3 quarts of chyme enter the small intestine per minute.  It exits as a liquid.\n\nThe chyme then enters the large intestine.  The large intestine is a tube about 5 feet long.  Its job is to absorb water, and then pass the waste out.  It accomplishes this by reabsorbing most of the water from the chyme.  It also has finger-like protrusions, called \"plicae\", which absorb water.  The large intestine contracts to squeeze the chyme through.  Chyme that enters the large intestine is a liquid.  As the plicae absorb water, it becomes a solid.  This is called \"stool\".  It passes through the large intestine as a solid.\n\nSo, the answer is that gastric juices (digestive juices from the stomach) and enzymes digest the apple in the stomach.  The stomach churns the apple.  The chyme is then squeezed through the small intestine, and the villi absorb the nutrients into the bloodstream.  Finally the plicae absorb water from the chyme, turning it into stool.\n\nComment: I don't think the stomach is a \"muscular pouch\" (it has no pouches, and is not muscular at all). The digestion of the stomach is done solely by the acid. And the plicae are not finger-like protrusions, they are folds of the colon.\n\nComment: @Nathaniel: In the human stom", "When you eat, the food is mixed with water, and other substances, and is carried through the esophagus to your stomach.\nIn the stomach, there are cells in the lining of the stomach that produce hydrochloric acid.\nThe acid breaks up the food, so that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.\n\nIf something is harmful, the acid will trigger the vomiting center in the brain (the medulla oblongata) to send a signal to the stomach to contract (kick).\n\nThis contraction forces the contents of the stomach upwards through the esophagus and out of your mouth.\n\nComment: Welcome to the site, @Gabe! If you haven't already done so, please take the [tour] and read [answer].", "It's simply gravity and the fact that the air pressure is lower at the top of your esophagus than at the bottom (due to it being open to the atmosphere).\n\nThere are two ways to regurgitate food back up:\n\n1) The food is still in the esophagus, so it just comes back up.\n\n2) The food has gone into the stomach, so the stomach has to excrete it.\n\nIn case 2), the stomach has to use the same muscles that push food down to push food back up. However, food is normally pushed down by the esophagus's own muscles. At the top of the esophagus, where the muscles are, the food is pushed up into the stomach (by gravity) and the stomach doesn't have to help.\n\nHaving learned that, you may now ask a more interesting question: how does the stomach know not to push food down when it is being pushed up?\n\nAnswer: If someone doesn't know about gravity it's difficult to get an intuitive grasp of how it works.\n\nThe best way to think of gravity is as a tension between two masses.  When you drop something it's the tension between the earth and the thing you dropped that pulls the thing down.  When you push something up it's the tension between the thing you pushed up and the thing you pushed it up with that has to be overcome.\n\nAnd I think it's easier to understand with an analogy.  When you lift a car off the ground it's the tension between the ground and the car that pulls the car up.  When you push a car it's the tension between the car and the ground that you push against.\n\nSo when you eat, the food is pushed down by the tension between it and the stomach.  When you vomit, it's the tension between the stomach and the outside world that pushes the food up through your esophagus.\n\nAnswer: Think of it this way:\n\nWhen you are eating, the food is pushed down by the muscles in your esophagus. When you are vomiting, the food is pushed up by the muscles in your esophagus.\n\nAnswer: The answer is that the muscles in your esophagus are contracting and relaxing to move things up and down. When the muscles are contracting, they are pushing the food up. When they are relaxing, they are allowing the food to move down."]}

Record the noise and then amplify the noise and play it back.\n\nAnswer: Microphones are really sensitive and can't be placed everywhere, so, you'd imagine that you'd need to record the noise and then play it back to cancel it out. But this wouldn't work, as it'd be too quiet to cancel out the real noise with the inverted noise.\n\nSo, the headphones themselves are basically mini microphones that pick up the noise, and then invert it, and play that back in the headphones.\n\nIf you've ever had a mic and used a mic booster, it's the same principle.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item A microphone\n\\item A speaker\n\\item An amplifier\n\\item A processor\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf you have all of these, you can make a device that will cancel out noise.\n\nYou first of all record the noise using the microphone.

What if the noise cancelling headphones use two microphones? One of the microphones listens to the noise, and the other microphone listens to the noise that is made by the headphones. The microphones then send the data to the processor. The processor calculates the inverse of the noise and sends the inverse to the headphones. The headphones then create noise that is the inverse of the noise that is being listened to. This would cancel the noise out.\n\nComment: This is a good theory, but it won't work.

{"prompt": "How much of sexual orientation is innate? Can being gay or straight be societally influenced?", "response_list": ["This is a long-standing question in science, and there really is no consensus.  I think most researchers agree that for some people, sexual orientation is very strongly innate, but for others it may be more influenced by social factors.  I don't think we have a good handle on the relative contributions of each.  There is a lot of evidence that the brain of a homosexual person generally looks different from a heterosexual person, but not necessarily in a way that we can say one is \"correct\" and the other \"mistaken\".  See the following articles for a good overview of the current state of this literature:\n\n[Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Brain Structure in Adults by James, et al. (2013)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471682)\n\n[Brain Structure and Functional Connectivity Associated with Homosexual Behavior by Savic, et al.

(2003)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12822916)\n\nThese papers and others like them also point to evidence that sexual orientation is strongly influenced by social factors.  Although the research isn't conclusive, it's safe to say that if you are raised in a culture that is highly heterosexual (like the US), you will probably exhibit more heterosexual behavior than if you were raised in a culture that is highly homosexual.  This is why researchers sometimes use twin studies to try to isolate the genetic component of sexual orientation.  If identical twins are raised in the same household, they should have very similar sexual orientation.  If fraternal twins, who are not genetically identical, are raised in the same household, they should have the same sexual orientation, but it is likely to be different from their co-twin's, since they are not genetically identical.  Using this methodology, researchers have found that the genetic component of sexual orientation is about 50% (see the following article for a good overview of this literature: [Genetic and Environmental Influences on Same-Sex Sexual Behavior in Women by Bailey, et al. (2000)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10727606)).\n\nComment: The 50% number is based on a relatively small sample size, and has been called into question by subsequent research.\n\nComment: @Jeromy Anglim: I think that's a fair point.  Most of the research on this topic is relatively new, and there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\nAnswer: There is evidence that sexual orientation is to some degree genetically determined. To quote from [the Wikipedia article on sexual orientation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association states that \"[s]cientists generally agree that sexual orientation is biologically determined\" and \"[i]ts development is likely influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.\"\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: I understand that \"the American Psychiatric Association\" is a large organization, but it is not a scientific body.  It is a professional organization of physicians and psychiatrists.\n\nAnswer: I would say that is a good question, because the answer is not known.\n\nIt is not possible to answer in general because there are too many variables.\n\nComment: What I think you're getting at here is that it's not a single variable. It's a combination of a number of variables that we don't fully understand yet.\n\nComment: @Mitchell: That is what I am getting at.\n\nAnswer: For the most part, yes. There are of course exceptions, and some people do choose to be a certain way, but for the most part, our sexual orientation is innate. There is no one gene responsible, but it is the combination of genes that make us who we are.\n\nComment: Do you have any sources for this?\n\nComment: @Mitchell: http://www.bbc.co.uk/", "There is no evidence that sexual orientation is anything other than innate, and a lot of evidence that it is.\n\nThere is no evidence that being gay or straight is \"societally influenced.\"\n\nComment: I am not talking of gay or straight. Even being heterosexual is not innate. It is a choice.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - I'm not sure why you would say that.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - That is a very strange claim. Even if it were true, it would be a very unusual kind of choice--one that is made without the person being aware of it. But that's not how the brain works.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - Of course, there is plenty of evidence that sexual orientation is innate.\n\nAnswer: As far as I know, there are no studies that directly measure the effects of cultural environment on sexual orientation. But there are studies that measure the effects of genetic environment on sexual orientation.\n\n[DNA Science blog](http://blogs.plos.org/dnascience/2011/03/30/sexual-orientation-genetics-and-environment/) describes how researchers used genetic markers in the Y chromosome to study the effects of genetic environment on sexual orientation. Specifically, the genetic markers were used to estimate how closely related the fathers of the participants were to each other - a measure of the participants' genetic environment.\n\nThe results showed that the effect of genetic environment was very small, and the effect of cultural environment was much larger. [This paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0013772) describes the study.\n\nComment: I am not sure if this is a valid study.\n\nComment: @Saurabh:  Please explain why you think this is not a valid study.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - I'm not sure how you know it is not a valid study.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - I don't know how you know that.\n\nComment: @Saurabh - It's a very good study.", "The majority of what we know about sexual orientation comes from studies of adults. This information can be used to make inferences about the roots of sexual orientation in children.\n\nThere are many different factors that can influence the development of sexual orientation. It is very likely that biological factors, environmental factors, and individual differences in development all play a role.\n\nStudies have found that biological factors might influence sexual orientation in a number of ways.\n\nIn a study of over 1400 pairs of identical twins, Bailey et al. (2000) found that if one twin was gay, the other twin was gay about 50% of the time. Because identical twins share all genes, this suggests that a biological factor is at least partially responsible for sexual orientation.\n\nIn an extensive study of the genes of over 400 homosexual men and over 500 heterosexual men, Bogaert and Hutson (2004) found that a number of genes were associated with sexual orientation. For example, one of the genes was associated with testosterone levels and was found to be more common in homosexual men than in heterosexual men. However, these genes are only responsible for about 10% of the variance in sexual orientation.\n\nAnother study of 205 gay men found that they were more likely to have had a family member with a mental illness than a control group of 100 heterosexual men (Nicolosi, 1991). Because mental illnesses are associated with hormonal imbalances, this suggests that hormonal factors might influence sexual orientation.\n\nThe environment in which a person grows up might also influence sexual orientation.\n\nSexual orientation is a relatively new concept. It took until the middle of the 19th century for it to even be discussed. Before this, there was no language to describe it.\n\nIn 1896, a psychologist by the name of Havelock Ellis wrote a book called Sexual Inversion. It was the first time in history that the concept of homosexuality had been discussed and named.\n\nEllis believed that homosexuality was caused by a lack of parental affection. He believed that parents who showed little affection to their children were likely to produce homosexual children.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sigmund Freud believed that boys who were overly close to their mothers might develop homosexual tendencies. This would be because the boy would have to compete with his mother for his father's attention.\n\nIn the 1930s, Freud's student, Karen Horney, developed the \"womb envy\" theory. She believed that the \"masculinity-femininity\" dichotomy was innate and that homosexuality was caused by an overly close relationship between a boy and his mother.\n\nIn the 1940s, psychoanalysts began to question the biological basis of homosexuality. They began to think that homosexuality could be caused by a boy's lack of a father figure.\n\nIn the 1950s, Alfred Kinsey published his groundbreaking book, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, in which he described his findings on the prevalence of homosexuality. In the book, he noted that homosexual behavior was more common in boys who had been separated from their fathers at an early age.\n\nIn the 1960s, the psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality were challenged by new research. Studies showed that the majority of homosexual men had not had a close relationship with their mothers, and that the majority of homosexual women had not had a close relationship with their fathers.\n\nIn the 1970s, the psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality were largely rejected. They were replaced by new theories that focused on the role of sexual orientation in identity development.\n\nIn the 1980s, new research showed that the majority of homosexual men had had a close relationship with their mothers, and that the majority of homosexual women had had a close relationship with their fathers.\n\nIn the 1990s, new research showed that the majority of homosexual men had had a close relationship with their fathers, and that the majority of homosexual women had had a close relationship with their mothers.\n\nFinally, in the", "The answer is yes.\n\nIf you were to grow up in a very homosexual community, you'd probably be very gay.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThere are many people who are born with a penis and raised as women, and raised as women, and who remain attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThat's because they are raised as women and not men.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThere are many people who are born with a penis and raised as men, and raised as men, and who remain attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThat's because they are raised as men and not women.\n\nIt's all about socialization.\n\n\\strong{Male}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIf you were to grow up in a very homosexual community, you'd probably be very gay.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nPeople are not raised in a very homosexual community.\n\nWhen a male is raised as a female, they will be attracted to men.\n\nWhen a male is raised as a male, they will be attracted to women.\n\n\\strong{Why?}\n\nBecause the male has a penis.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThere are many people who are born with a penis and raised as women, and raised as women, and who remain attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThere are many people who are born with a penis and raised as men, and raised as men, and who remain attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThat's because they are raised as men and not women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt's not about being raised as men and women, it's about being raised with a penis and not being raised with a penis.\n\n\\strong{Female}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen a female is raised as a female, they will be attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen a female is raised as a male, they will be attracted to men.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen a female is raised as a male, they will be attracted to women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nYes.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThat's because they are raised as men and not women.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt's not about being raised as men and women, it's about being raised with a vagina and not being raised with a vagina.\n\nComment: Are you claiming that homosexuality does not exist?\n\nComment: @VinzenzM\u00fcller What I'm claiming is that there is no such thing as homosexuality.

In that study, he identified 37 percent of the men he interviewed as exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55.\n\nIn 1983, Evelyn Hooker published a study demonstrating that, on average, the self-esteem of homosexual men was not significantly different from that of heterosexual men.\n\nThe Kinsey and Hooker studies were not the first to examine how sexual orientation develops. Since at least the time of Plato and Aristotle, scientific and cultural debates have been fueled by questions about how sexuality develops.\n\nScientists and the general population have often viewed homosexuality as a sign of immorality or mental illness. In the past, it was considered immoral and criminal in many countries. It was not until the 1950s that the United States began to decriminalize homosexuality. It was not until the 1970s that the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.\n\nThese views have had a significant impact on the development of science and the public perception of homosexuality. To avoid discrimination, many gay and lesbian people have not been open about their sexual orientation.\n\nThe study of sexual orientation has been influenced by these views for decades. However, over the past 50 years, the scientific community has begun to change its mind. In 1993, the American Psychological Association issued a statement supporting gay rights and condemning discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation.\n\nThese developments may have had an impact on the study of sexual orientation.

{"prompt": "If electric turbos are a thing why cant exhaust gasses be used to generate electricity for the car?", "response_list": ["There are indeed many, many things that could be done with the exhaust.  One way is to use an electric turbo, and a hybrid, that uses the exhaust to recover energy.  This is an option for a hybrid because the exhaust is already there.  But if you're starting from scratch, you're going to have a lot of trouble just getting a hybrid working.\n\nOne of the main problems is that the exhaust is low pressure.  In order to get useful power, you'd have to use a Rankine cycle engine.  The problem with a Rankine cycle engine is that you have to build a separate low pressure system to capture that exhaust.  So you have to have a separate engine, and a separate cooling system, and a separate low pressure system to capture the exhaust.\n\nYou could use a turbine, but it would have to be very small.  A turbine that is even 1/10th the size of the engine is going to produce only a fraction of the power.  So you'd end up with a very inefficient system, and a very small motor.  If you're starting with a low power motor, it's very hard to get it to produce enough power to run.\n\nThere is another problem with a Rankine cycle engine.  While a Rankine cycle engine is very efficient at low power, it is not nearly as efficient as a regular car engine.  You're going to waste a lot of fuel just to produce the energy to run the engine.\n\nComment: So, 20 years from now, when that 100kW hybrid car is in the middle of nowhere, and its battery is dead.  What's going to power the 40kW electric motor to get it to the nearest charging station?  A 10kW generator?  A 2kW generator?  A 1kW generator?\n\nComment: What about using the exhaust to create a vacuum and feed that into a normal engine?  I'm not sure if this would work but it seems like it would at least be better than nothing.\n\nComment: The way to get a 100kW hybrid to a charging station is to give it a 100kW hybrid.  There are plenty of electrical power sources out there.  There are plenty of gasoline sources out there.  There are plenty of solar sources out there.  It's just a matter of how much you want to pay to install them.  You can't just make a 100kW hybrid out of nothing.  You have to pay for it.\n\nComment: @Dave: If you have a big enough turbo to produce enough power, you can certainly use it to generate electricity.  But the same problem applies.  A turbine that is 1/10th the size of the engine is going to produce only a fraction of the power.  You'd have to have a very large turbine, and a very large battery.  It wouldn't be a very practical system.\n\nAnswer: Your question is not clear. Are you asking why we don't use the exhaust to power the vehicle? If that's the case then the short answer is that gasoline engines are highly inefficient. Most of the energy in the fuel is produced as heat rather than as mechanical energy. And it is not easy to convert heat to mechanical energy.\n\nComment: The question is not clear, because the question is stupid.", "There are a few reasons why this is not the case.\n\nFirst, the combustion process is not very efficient at generating electricity.\n\nSecond, the exhaust gases are hot, and you need to do work to get them to expand, which is what a turbo does.\n\nThird, the exhaust gases are a mixture of gases, and it would be very difficult to get a turbine to extract energy from all of the gases efficiently.\n\nFourth, the exhaust gases are dirty, and you would need a very clean environment to use them to generate electricity.\n\nFinally, the exhaust gases are very hot, and you would need a very cool environment to use them to generate electricity.\n\nComment: Well, it is possible to run a turbo off of exhaust gasses, but the gasses would need to be cooled significantly first. The exhaust from modern gasoline engines is still so hot that it would damage the turbine blades.\n\nComment: So you would use exhaust gasses to generate electricity which would power a fan which would cool the gasses which would power the turbo which would power the car?", "\\begin{blockquote}\nIf electric turbos are a thing why can't exhaust gasses be used to generate electricity for the car?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause the turbine is not a generator, it is simply a turbine converting engine exhaust pressure into mechanical work. It's that mechanical work that is then applied to the compressor, not any electrical output.\n\nIn order to make electricity from exhaust gasses, you will need a generator, which will also require a turbine to drive it.  You will need to get the exhaust gasses to the turbine.  If you're using a turbocharger, you will have to find a way to get the exhaust gasses to the turbine without compromising the turbocharger.\n\nOne possible solution would be to use the turbine from a [waste heat recovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_heat_recovery) system, but that too has [issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocompound#Disadvantages).\n\nComment: So the gasses from the engine go to the turbocharger and then the exhaust gasses come out and go to the generator?\n\nComment: The exhaust gasses don't go to the turbocharger, the turbocharger is used on the exhaust gasses.  The turbocharger takes the exhaust gasses and converts their pressure into mechanical work to drive the compressor, which helps the engine breathe.  The exhaust gasses then go out the exhaust pipe.\n\nComment: I thought the turbocharger took air from the engine and then forced it into the engine?\n\nComment: @user2063462: No, the turbocharger takes exhaust gasses and spins.  The exhaust gasses spin the turbocharger, and the turbocharger spins the compressor, which helps the engine breath more air.\n\nComment: I've always thought that it takes air from the engine and compresses it but it sounds like it takes the exhaust gasses and spins the turbocharger which then spins the compressor?\n\nComment: @user2063462: The turbocharger is driven by the exhaust gasses, the compressor is driven by the turbocharger.  The air is sucked into the engine, the exhaust gasses are forced out.  The exhaust gasses go to the turbocharger.\n\nComment: @user2063462: This is the sort of thing you should learn in a basic auto mechanics class.\n\nComment: I did learn about this class but I never took it.\n\nComment: @user2063462: Then you should learn about it on your own.  One of the best ways to do that is to take the car apart and see how it works.  It's not that hard, and the more you do it, the more you will understand about how a car works and how to maintain it.\n\nComment: I'm trying to learn more about it but I can only learn it so fast.\n\nComment: @user2063462: You can learn as fast as you want.  You just need to take the time to learn.  Take apart a car, read about how it works.\n\nComment: What car would you suggest I take apart?\n\nComment: @user2063462: The car you own.  You'll learn a lot by taking it apart and putting it back together.  You'll learn a lot about how it works, and you'll learn how to change a lot of things, like oil, brake pads, etc.  You'll learn how to fix a lot of little things.  You'll also learn how to do a lot of maintenance, which is also very important.\n\nAnswer: The main reason electric turbochargers are not widely used is because they are inefficient.  The electric motor and the turbocharger are both 100% efficient.  However, the electrical conversion is not 100% efficient.  This can be improved by using better materials and technology, but it will never be 100%.\n\nExhaust waste heat recovery is a possible solution.  The problem is that it is also inefficient.  The process of recovering energy from an exhaust gas is inefficient.  The engine heat is being generated with the purpose of pushing", "I'm not sure I understand the question.\n\nThis has already been done, in a sense.  Turbocharged engines are often also supercharged.  The supercharger uses energy from the engine to spin the compressor.  The turbocharger uses energy from exhaust gases to spin the compressor.  The difference is that the supercharger uses more energy, but that energy is supplied by the engine.  Turbochargers use less energy, but that energy is supplied by the fuel.\n\nComment: I understand that the energy is used to spin the compressor. What I am asking is if the energy can be used to charge the battery of the car?\n\nComment: @AlexanderHonkanen You'd need a generator to do that.  There's no free lunch.\n\nComment: I guess that means that the turbocharger is used because it is better than a supercharger? Or is it more a matter of cost?\n\nComment: @AlexanderHonkanen It's more a matter of physics.  A turbocharger gives you more power for less fuel.  A supercharger gives you more power for more fuel.  Which one is better depends on the application.\n\nComment: @Barry I understand that it is a matter of physics. My question was can this energy be used to charge the battery, instead of fuel? I understand that it increases the power with less fuel.\n\nComment: @AlexanderHonkanen You might want to explain why you think that would be better.  The energy recovered from the exhaust would be a small fraction of the energy recovered from the fuel, so you'd get less power.\n\nComment: @Barry I am asking this as a theoretical question. My main goal is to see if I am understanding the physics behind the turbocharger.\n\nComment: @AlexanderHonkanen If you want to use the exhaust energy to power the supercharger, you could do that.  It would just be less efficient than using the engine energy.  If you want to use the exhaust energy to power the battery, you could do that, too.  It would be less efficient than using the fuel energy.  The question of which is better depends on the application.", "The exhaust system of a car is not optimised to generate electricity, so it would be sub-optimal.\n\nEven if you had a system that worked, you would have to be able to generate more power than you would be consuming.  Because the exhaust system is not designed to generate electricity, it would be very inefficient.\n\nComment: So, I guess you have to have a pretty powerful engine to even get to the point where you're generating enough power to offset the inefficiencies of such a system.  The question remains as to why this is not done already.\n\nComment: It's not done because it would be inefficient and too expensive to implement.  The engine wastes a lot of energy as it is, and to convert that into electricity would require a lot of extra equipment.\n\nComment: @Gort the problem is that you need to run electricity through a motor to do that, and the motor would also be inefficient.  The only way to do that would be to have a turbine generator in the exhaust system that was powered by exhaust gasses, and that is not feasible.\n\nComment: The question is what about cars that are not EV and have engine that produce a lot of power? Surely they would be able to produce more power than they consume.\n\nComment: @Gort again, what you would be doing is taking energy from a turbine and converting it to electricity using a generator.  The efficiency of the generator would be significantly lower than the efficiency of the turbine, so it would be inefficient over all.\n\nComment: @Gort it's a very good idea, but it's not feasible.  You would have to have a turbine that was driven by exhaust gasses, and then use the mechanical energy to generate electricity.  The problem is that the energy from the turbine would be wasted.  You have to have a generator that converts mechanical energy to electricity, and the generator is not efficient at all.  The energy lost would be greater than the energy that you would save.\n\nComment: @Gort If you have a powerful engine, then the amount of energy that you would be losing would be even higher.  You would be wasting more energy than you would be saving.\n\nComment: So, turbine, generator, exhaust gasses. How is this any more inefficient than a turbo?\n\nComment: @Gort you're not comparing like with like.  A turbo is designed to generate power.  It's an extremely efficient design, and there is a lot of research into how to make them more efficient.  A turbine and generator that are designed to generate electricity are not designed to generate power out of exhaust gasses.  They would be very inefficient, so it would be a waste of resources.\n\nAnswer: There are actually cars which have the ability to recover energy from the exhaust system.

{"prompt": "why cant we send a space rover on an asteroid and just leave it there using the asteroid\u2019s \u201corbit\u201d to enter other galaxies?", "response_list": ["It is impossible to use the orbits of the asteroids to go to other galaxies.\n\nWhy? Because the speed needed to escape the solar system is about 40 km/s.  The fastest asteroid goes at 10 km/s.  This means that you cannot use the asteroids to go to other galaxies.\n\nThe only way is to use the Sun.  You need to use the Sun as a slingshot to get to high speeds.  This is done by going really close to the Sun (a few million km) and then going really fast in the opposite direction.  You can get as far as the Oort Cloud this way.  (The Oort Cloud is 1000 AU away from the Sun.)  To go the rest of the way to other stars, you need to use other stars.\n\nComment: But can we use the asteroid\u2019s orbit to send a space rover to another galaxy?\n\nComment: @Sara_Rose No.  You need to use the Sun as a slingshot.  As I said, you cannot use the asteroids.\n\nComment: I just have a question, what is the difference between asteroids and meteoroids?\n\nComment: @SaraRose They are the same thing.  A meteoroid is a small asteroid.  It is just a matter of convention.\n\nComment: I was just wondering because I thought asteroids were huge rocks floating around in space.\n\nComment: @SaraRose  Yes, they are huge rocks floating around in space.  Meteoroid is just a convention to differentiate them from bigger things.\n\nComment: \"The fastest asteroid goes at 10 km/s.\" This is wrong. The fastest asteroid goes at 40 km/s.\n\nAnswer: The asteroids are actually travelling at about 20 km per second. This is pretty fast.  But the speed of light is about 300 000 km per second! The asteroids are travelling at 0.00001% the speed of light. (This number is 10^(-6), which is written as 10 to the power of (-6) or 0.000001. 10^(-6) is 1 divided by 1000000. 10^(-6) is 1 divided by 1000000. 10^(-6) is 1 divided by 1000000.\n\nSo going to another star system is like travelling 300 000 km per second.  The asteroids are travelling at only 20 km per second.  It would take a long time to go to another star system.\n\nComment: This is wrong. The asteroids are travelling at about 20 km per second.

For instance, there are places in the asteroid belt that have no gravity at all, but in another place, there is more than enough gravity to hold an object orbiting the sun.  Is that not true?\n\nComment: @ShawnS. That is true, but, the gravitational effects of other objects in the solar system are still negligible compared to the Sun. For example, the mass of Jupiter is just a bit more than 300 times the mass of the Earth. The mass of Jupiter is about 1/1000th of the mass of the Sun.\n\nComment: @ShawnS.

Those are the terms used in the proposed project.\n\nComment: Thanks for the edit.  I've never heard of the light sail, and the probe was just an example.\n\nComment: You're welcome, but I would suggest checking out the Wikipedia article on the project:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhy cant we send a space rover on an asteroid and just leave it there using the asteroid's \"orbit\" to enter other galaxies?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBecause you need to accelerate the asteroid to a very high speed to move it outside the solar system.\n\nAccording to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars), the nearest star (albeit a binary system) is about 4.2 light years away. Assuming a constant acceleration of 1 g, it would take about 100,000 years to reach that distance.\n\nIf you could accelerate the asteroid to 100 km/s, it would take less than 1000 years. This is still much more than a human lifetime, but it is in principle possible.\n\nI doubt you will be able to accelerate a large enough asteroid for your purposes.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nhow can we send a rocket to an asteroid using the asteroid's orbit?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe asteroid's orbit is not a path that can be used to send a spacecraft to another location, since the spacecraft will not have the same starting point as the asteroid.\n\nAnswer: It will not work because the asteroid is not in orbit around the sun. It is in orbit around a point in space (its barycenter). The sun's barycenter is at the center of the solar system.\n\nIf you want to use the asteroid's orbit to go elsewhere, you will have to make it into an artificial satellite. This means you will have to use a rocket to take it out of the asteroid belt, decelerate it into a lower orbit, and then accelerate it again to a higher orbit.\n\nOnce in orbit around the sun, you can use the asteroid's orbit to go elsewhere in the solar system.\n\nComment: And it is not easy to move an asteroid, but it is possible.  There is a method to move an asteroid.  It is called \"gravity tractor\".  A spacecraft moves near the asteroid, and the gravitational attraction of the spacecraft pulls the asteroid.  It takes a long time, but it works.

It takes a very long time.  For example, see [this](http://www.space.com/21230-move-asteroid-planetary-defense-mission.html)\n\nComment: @AldoRomanos It is possible to use a gravity tractor to move a large asteroid, but it will take a very long time.  And it will be very expensive.  It will be cheaper to build a spacecraft that will move to the asteroid, land, and mine it.\n\nComment: @AldoRomanos If you use a gravity tractor, you have to be careful not to hit the asteroid.  It is hard to calculate where the asteroid will be in the future.  You could hit the asteroid, and that will cause all of the asteroid's momentum to change direction.  It will be like hitting a truck.\n\nComment: The asteroid is moving around the sun, and it is possible to use that motion to travel to other places.  For example, you could use the motion to move to the moon.  You could use the motion to move to other places in the Solar System.  But you need to find a way to get the asteroid to move to a higher orbit.  Then you can use the motion to go to other places.", "It would be \\strong{very difficult} to place a spacecraft on a trajectory that would cause it to remain in orbit around an asteroid.  The reason is that the asteroid itself is in an orbit around the sun, and the spacecraft would have to be placed on a trajectory which would follow the asteroid in its orbit.

Is it cheaper than building a space station in Earth orbit?  Does it offer some scientific advantage?  The answer to this question depends on what you are trying to do.\n\nComment: I was just wondering if I could send a rover to an asteroid and just leave it there.\n\nAnswer: The problem is that the asteroid orbits the sun, so any orbit around it is also an orbit around the sun. A spacecraft in such an orbit would eventually rejoin the asteroid.\n\nFor example, if your spacecraft orbit were 100 km above the surface, it would be orbiting the sun at 100 km above the surface of the asteroid. The orbit would have a period of about 50 minutes (i.e. the same as the asteroid).\n\nIf a spacecraft were to be left on the asteroid, it would probably fall to the surface, or at least be pulled into the asteroid's orbit.\n\nAnswer: The asteroid is in an orbit around the Sun, so is the spacecraft.\n\nAt some point the spacecraft will catch up with the asteroid and they will once again be in the same orbit, around the Sun.\n\nThe reason we don't have any spacecraft in orbit around an asteroid is because it is not in Earth's orbit.  It is in an orbit around the Sun.\n\nComment: Yes, but the spacecraft will not be in the same orbit as the asteroid.  If the spacecraft had a trajectory that was in the same orbit as the asteroid, it would eventually rejoin the asteroid."]}

Then, get in contact with their faculty (email, phone, etc.) and explain to them your situation. You might be able to get them to vouch for you and help you get into a graduate program.\n\nComment: \"As you are in the early stages of grad school, you will have more options than you will have later\" -- I don't think this necessarily applies to a European PhD, where there is no \"early stages\" as such.", "First, I think that the most important thing that you can do is to find someone to talk to.  I would suggest finding someone who is a member of your minority group, since they will probably be more knowledgeable about the issues that you are facing.  Your advisor, a TA, or a club leader may be good options, depending on your situation.  Talking to people about the situation should make you feel better, and it may also provide you with some advice.  It may also help you realize that you are not alone in facing these sorts of problems.\n\nThe second thing I would suggest is that you try to find a way to get involved with the research of your advisor that is unrelated to your MA thesis.  For example, you could join a lab, volunteer to help with a research project, or assist with a class.  This will allow you to get to know your advisor better, and you may become more familiar with the research that your advisor is doing, which may make it easier to find a topic for your thesis.  It may also provide you with some experience that will help you in your job search.  Also, if you are doing more than just your thesis, it should make it easier to explain to your advisor that you are not just trying to get a grade, but are actually interested in doing research.\n\nThe third thing that you can do is to work on building your resume.  One way to do this is by volunteering for an organization.  This will allow you to develop some skills, and it will also look good on your resume.  You may also want to think about applying for scholarships or internships.  All of these things will help to impress your advisor, and it may make it easier for you to find a supervisor.\n\nFinally, I would suggest that you try to stay positive.  It is easy to get discouraged when you are facing a lot of problems, but it is important to remember that things will get better.  I know that it is hard, but try to focus on the good things in your life, and try to avoid dwelling on the negative.\n\nComment: I agree that talking to someone is a good idea.  It's also a good idea to write down what you want to say, and practice saying it out loud.  That will help you be clear about what you want to say, and may help you avoid saying something that can be easily misunderstood.\n\nComment: Yes, you are right.  It is important to be clear when you are talking to someone about this sort of thing, since you don't want to give the wrong impression.\n\nComment: If you are in an undergraduate program, I would suggest talking to a counselor.  They can help you to figure out what you want to do, and they may be able to provide you with some advice on how to deal with the situation.

I was a PhD student in math a few years later.  I went on the job market the following year and had a job offer from a major research university.  I turned it down because I had been a math major at a small, non-PhD granting college and I had never had a black woman professor.

I've never been in your situation, but I suspect the only thing you can do is keep trying.\n\nIt's possible that the professors are prejudiced, but it's also possible that they have had some bad experiences with students from your race and/or gender.\n\nThere are many things you can do, some more obvious than others.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Really, really work hard to make sure they don't have a bad experience with you. Do good work, and if you can, try to work with them in some other way too.\n\\item Let them know you're aware of the stereotype. Some people don't realize that everyone knows about it, but I suspect most of your professors do realize that. You might remind them, but I wouldn't make a big deal about it.\n\\item Don't argue with the professor about bad grades. Instead of arguing, try to learn why they think you got the grade you did. If you have good arguments why you should get a better grade, then you might be able to convince them to change your grade.\n\\item After you graduate from the program, write the professors a personalized letter thanking them for their help.\n\\item If you have a good relationship with a professor in your program, ask them for advice.\n\\item If you don't have a good relationship with a professor in your program, ask other people in the department for advice.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnswer: If you feel your grades are unfair, I would suggest talking to your advisor about this. At the very least, your advisor might be able to point you towards another professor that is willing to supervise your thesis. It's important to keep trying to find a supervisor, because you will likely need one to graduate.\n\nI would also suggest looking into other thesis options.  Some universities have a thesis-option and a project option, for example.  At my university, a student that is doing a project can get the same degree as a student that is doing a thesis (even though the project students do not have a thesis supervisor).\n\nI hope everything works out for you!\n\nComment: I've never had an advisor.", "If you are a PhD student:\n\nSpeak to your department head and explain the issues you are having with your supervisor.\n\nIf you are not a PhD student:\n\nIf the stereotype is about all students with your race-gender combo doing fraud and plagiarism, then there's not much you can do about it.

Of course there are some who need help, but there are many more who don't.  The ones who do need help have a variety of ways they can get it.\n\nAn officer's police psychologist is the first person to go to if the officer is having difficulty dealing with trauma.  There is also a confidential hotline available to all police officers and their family members 24 hours a day.  (I used to work there.)\n\nThe officer's chaplain is also available to talk about anything and everything, and that includes trauma.\n\nThe department also has a lot of other resources available.  The first one is the Peer Support Team, which is made up of officers who have been through a 40 hour course in dealing with trauma.  They know how police officers work and can help in many ways.\n\nThe department also has a \"Wellness Program\" which includes a monthly newsletter with articles on a variety of topics including dealing with trauma.  They have a yearly Wellness Conference for police employees, and a yearly Wellness Retreat for police officers and their families.  They also have a Wellness Center available to all employees.  It is a room with a couch, a coffee pot and a refrigerator, and it is a place where people can go to relax and get away from work for a few minutes.\n\nThe department also offers a variety of classes to help deal with trauma.  They have a monthly \"Wellness Day\", which is a day where all employees can go to a variety of classes to help them deal with stress and trauma.  They also have a \"Stress Management\" class that they offer to new officers, which helps officers deal with stress and trauma.  And they also have a \"Cop Talk\" class which helps police officers deal with trauma as well as other issues.\n\nComment: +1 For the answer, but -1 for the 'it's all ok' attitude.  I disagree with the statement that 'many more police officers don't need help' because I don't think a police officer can be in their line of work without experiencing some sort of trauma.  Perhaps you're implying that the majority of trauma is manageable, and that's probably true, but I've known police officers who have gone through a lot of traumatic experiences and still haven't sought help.  I think that's the point the OP is trying to make.\n\nComment: @Richard:  I don't think I made that point.  I made the point that there are many more police officers who don't need help with trauma than those who do.  I don't think it's possible to be in police work without experiencing trauma.  And you're right that I didn't say many of the traumas were manageable.  Some are not.  I said that those who need help have a variety of ways they can get help.  I'm sure the OP knows that.\n\nAnswer: I'm not sure that I can speak for police officers, but I can speak for the military. In basic training, we were given a series of written and verbal tests to determine if we were candidates for a \"psych\" eval. If we passed, that meant that we did not show any signs of \"psychotic episodes\". If we got sent to the psych, that meant we were candidates for having psychotic episodes (schizophrenia, PTSD, etc).\n\nI was sent to the psych as a candidate, and during my evaluation, I was told that 70% of the population of the United States is candidates for having psychotic episodes. I was told that I was not more likely to have a psychotic episode than anyone else; I was just as likely as the next guy.\n\nThe point is, there's no single \"thing\" that makes a person more likely to be a victim of PTSD than the next.\n\nNow, I'm not trying to say that there's no difference between a police officer and a normal civilian, but I am trying to say that everyone is a candidate. You can be one of the 30% that never gets PTSD, or one of the 70% that is a candidate. If you're a candidate, you might never get PTSD, you might get it, or you might get it and recover.\n\nI think it's pretty safe to say that it'", "I've known a few, and they've told me that they don't become \"numb\" to the crime scenes they've seen, but they develop a more \"clinical\" approach, and often don't let themselves have an emotional reaction unless it's a case involving children.\n\nI've also known a few (not cops) who had to deal with people dying in front of them.  For them it was a little different, they just had to \"get on with it\" and do their job.  For a nurse, it's part of the job description.  For a cop, they have to get used to it, because it's part of the job description too.\n\nAnswer: I've seen people that have lived through a war, and I've seen people who have seen the worst of humanity in their job. In all cases, the people were changed.\n\nI don't know how they managed to do their job. I guess they must have been very strong.\n\nI'm not saying that you should not do it. It's just something that I would really think about.\n\nAnswer: I think you need to decide what you want from your life and career.  I think you are doing the right thing by questioning before committing.  I'm not sure if I could do the job.  I don't think I could do the job.  I would not want to be the one that has to examine the scene where a child was killed or a rape victim.  I would not want to spend my days trying to find the bad guy.  I would not want to testify in court.\n\nI would guess that you are not going to find an answer that will satisfy your curiosity.  I would guess that you will find the answer in your own heart about what you can handle.\n\nThe cop that is called to a crime scene is not the same cop that is at the crime scene.  The cop that is called to a crime scene is the guy that gets pissed off when he gets the call to the crime scene.  The guy that is at the crime scene is the guy that does his job.

While I do not like it, I can do it, and I can do it effectively.\n\nThe same is true for homicide detectives.  They have a certain level of training that helps them deal with things that most people cannot.  There are classes on how to deal with dead bodies, how to maintain composure when dealing with the family of the victim, and other training courses.  It's not easy, but it is possible.\n\nI have seen a dead body maybe a dozen times in my career, and I have seen them in all kinds of states.  I have seen a burned body, a mutilated body, and a body that had been frozen.  I have seen a body that was decapitated and one that had a head that was missing.

Most of them are not sane to begin with.\n\nIn order to be a homicide detective, you must have a very strong stomach, a very strong will, and the ability to compartmentalise everything. You must be able to see a dead body, pick up the weapon that killed the victim, and then go back to work without much thought of what it is you just saw. You must be able to understand that the victim doesn't matter, and you must be able to focus on the case and the perpetrator.\n\nThis is a very bad job for most people.

The Wikipedia article does not state that Proxima Centauri is a part of the triple star system, only that it is a neighbour.

This die has a set of holes of the right size and shape to produce the product.  The die is often heated to keep the polymer soft, and some pressure is applied to push the polymer through the die.  The polymer is generally stretched by the pressure, and in the process, the polymer crystallizes.  This is a process called \"orientation.\"\n\nAs the polymer is stretched, the molecules that are stretched in the same direction are all aligned in the same direction, while the molecules that are stretched in a different direction are all aligned in a different direction.  If you look at the polymer under a microscope, you will see that the molecules are all aligned, and that they are arranged in \"stripes.\"  If you look at the polymer from a different direction, you will see that the stripes are arranged in a different way.  The molecules are all still aligned, but they are all aligned in a different direction.  If you look at the polymer from yet another direction, you will see yet another set of stripes.  All of these stripes are perpendicular to the direction in which the polymer was stretched.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r6zgA.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nThis orientation is generally very stable, and the polymer retains it for a relatively long time.  If you look at the polymer at different temperatures, you will see that the molecules are not all aligned at all temperatures.  At low temperatures, the molecules are all aligned, and the stripes are all perpendicular to the temperature.  At higher temperatures, the molecules are not aligned, and the stripes are not parallel to the temperature.\n\nWhen the polymer is cooled down, the molecules are aligned, and the stripes are all perpendicular to the temperature.

This was a very popular way to do \"instant\" photochromic glasses.\n\nThe way it works is that the plastic is transparent to UV light, but opaque to visible light.  When UV light hits it, it changes the molecular structure of the plastic, making it opaque to visible light, but transparent to UV light.  This is how you make the UV light trigger it.  When you bend the plastic, the stress caused by bending stretches out the polymer chains, making the molecular structure of the plastic more like the UV-transparent state, and the plastic becomes transparent again.\n\nComment: I'm wondering if this is the same as a \"memory\" effect.\n\nComment: @jameslarge - maybe, but not exactly.  I think a memory effect is when you have a single state that you can revert to by applying stress, and this is more like the opposite.\n\nComment: I think you've got it. I'd only add that the change of color is due to a change of refractive index, whereas the memory effect is usually thought of as a change in stiffness.\n\nComment: @jameslarge - good point.

{"prompt": "If ADHD is caused by having a lower baseline dopamine level, why is it so hard to diagnose? Can't we just measure dopamine levels?", "response_list": ["The short answer is, no, it can't be measured directly. This is because it is a dynamic process, which is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors.\n\nThe longer answer, as I discuss in [The Neuroscience of ADHD](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00LH77QY0), is that dopamine is a [neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter), which means that it is released by one neuron and causes a change in the electrical state of another neuron. Dopamine is released from a [synaptic vesicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_vesicle) in the terminal buttons of the neuron, and it is not free in the extracellular fluid. In addition, dopamine is metabolized by the enzyme [catechol-O-methyltransferase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechol-O-methyltransferase), commonly abbreviated as COMT. This enzyme degrades dopamine (in addition to serotonin and norepinephrine) by converting it to 3-methoxytyramine.\n\nWhen dopamine is released, it binds to the [D1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor) and [D2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine_receptor) receptors. The D1 receptors are located on G protein-coupled receptors, and the D2 receptors are on G protein-coupled receptors and [ion channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_channel). In any case, the effects of dopamine on these receptors are to increase the electrical excitation of the cell. The increased electrical excitation of the cell is what causes the effects of dopamine on the brain.\n\nComment: Thanks. I'm still confused.

However, dopamine levels in the blood aren't a good indicator of dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine levels in the blood are a good indicator of the amount of dopamine released by the pituitary gland, but dopamine released by the pituitary gland is a small amount compared to the amount of dopamine released in the brain.\n\nMeasuring dopamine levels in the brain is very difficult. The most common way to measure them is through a PET scan, which requires radiation. It's not possible for this to be used in a large scale study.\n\nMeasuring dopamine levels in the brain also has other problems. Dopamine is produced by three different types of brain cells, and each of these cells has a different way of releasing dopamine, so there isn't a single dopamine level for all of the cells in the brain.\n\nFinally, dopamine levels aren't the only things that increase ADHD symptoms. There are many other things that can cause ADHD symptoms, so even if we knew the exact dopamine level, the increase in dopamine wouldn't tell us if that's the thing that's causing the ADHD symptoms or not.\n\nComment: Thank you!  Very helpful.", "First, we don't know that ADHD is caused by having a lower baseline dopamine level, or even that this is correlated with ADHD. It is, however, possible that this is the case.\n\nHowever, in order to measure dopamine levels in a reliable and practical way, we would need to measure the concentration of dopamine in the brain. It is possible to measure dopamine levels in the blood, but this measurement is not sensitive enough to detect the smaller concentrations that would be typical of the brain.\n\nCurrently, we detect ADHD using behavioral measures such as the rating scales and checklists you mentioned.

It is possible, however, that these techniques will be used in the future for the diagnosis of ADHD.\n\nComment: I would add that the issue with imaging techniques is that there is no evidence that ADHD causes a particular pattern of activation or inhibition in the brain: it may be that the \"symptoms\" of ADHD are caused not by an inherent problem with the brain but by stress or anxiety or some other external factor.", "As far as I know, there is no evidence that ADHD is caused by a lower baseline dopamine level. There are a lot of theories that it is related to dopamine production, but there is no direct evidence that it is.\n\nAnswer: Dopamine levels in the brain do not affect whether or not someone is diagnosed with ADHD.\n\nScientists think that ADHD is caused by genetic mutations related to neurotransmitters, and that it is not caused by dopamine levels. Specifically, scientists believe that ADHD is caused by mutations in the genes that code for the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. In ADHD, the mutations cause the brain to produce less dopamine and norepinephrine, but more serotonin. The neurotransmitter imbalance makes the brain work less efficiently, which leads to ADHD symptoms.\n\nAnswer: Dopamine levels in the brain are not related to ADHD. ADHD is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps regulate the brain's reward system, which is responsible for motivation, pleasure, and the ability to focus.  The brain's reward system is thought to play a role in ADHD, but the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood. It is important to note that diagnosing ADHD is based on a combination of behavioral and cognitive assessments, and not on biological or chemical tests."]}

I've added another sentence to make that clear.\n\nComment: The answer is \"irrational\" not irrational number.\n\nAnswer: It's a good question, and one that's been around for a long time. In fact, there's a famous story about how it took a lot of work to convince Euclid that the number $\\pi$ is infinite.\n\nIn short, it's because $\\pi$ cannot be written as a fraction of two integers.

Consider the Pythagorean Theorem. If you have a triangle with sides $3$, $4$, and $5$, then the area of the triangle is $3\\times 4\\times 5 = 60$.\n\nBut if you assume that all numbers are finite, then the Pythagorean Theorem becomes meaningless. Why? Because you can always find an integer solution to the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$. For example, $1^2+1^2=2^2$, so $1$ is a solution to the equation. But what about $2^2+1^2=3^2$? That's also a solution. And $3^2+2^2=5^2$ is also a solution.\n\nYou can keep doing this forever. You can always find an integer solution to the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$.\n\nIn fact, you can do the same thing with any equation. You can always find an integer solution to the equation $x^2+y^2=z^2$.\n\nBut if you assume that all numbers are infinite, then the Pythagorean Theorem becomes meaningful again.\n\nComment: This is a good answer, but not exactly what they are asking. They are asking about numbers that are irrational, not numbers in general.\n\nComment: @j_random_hacker: You're right. I've updated my answer to address their question.\n\nAnswer: Pi is irrational. That means it is not the ratio of two integers, and we can't write it as the sum of rational numbers.\n\nAnd there is no such thing as a rational number that is greater than pi. That means that there is no way to write pi as the ratio of two rational numbers.\n\nComment: Irrational numbers are not numbers.  Rational numbers are numbers.  So, no, $\\pi$ is not a rational number.  It's not any kind of number.\n\nComment: @GerryMyerson:", "Imagine you have a sequence of real numbers $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,...$ such that $a,b,c,d,e$ are all distinct, and the difference between $a$ and $b$ is the same as the difference between $c$ and $d$ and so on.\n\nThen for each $n$ we have that $a+(n-1)b=c$, $a+nb=d$, $a+(n-1)d=e$, $a+nd=f$, $a+(n-1)f=g$, $a+ng=h$, ...\n\nNow, let's take for instance $g=h$ and $g+h=i$\n\nNow, we want to prove that $a+(n-1)h = i$\n\n\\begin{align}\na+(n-1)h &= a+(n-1)(g+h)\\\\\n&= a+ng+nh\\\\\n&= a+ng+g+h\\\\\n&= c+d\\\\\n&= i\n\\end{align}\n\nThus, by the principle of mathematical induction, we can extend this to any $n$ to obtain that\n\n$$a+(n-1)h = i$$\n\nNow, to prove that there are infinitely many terms, just notice that $a$ is fixed and that $a+(n-1)h=i$ implies that $h=i-a$ and that $h$ is fixed.\n\nThus, we have infinitely many elements in our sequence.\n\nComment: So that\u2019s the basic idea of induction.

It has to be boosted to a higher orbit whenever it is about to collide with other objects.  It is not boosted to a higher orbit just because it is about to stay up there forever.\n\nAs to the dangerous space junk, not every piece of it is at a stable orbit.  The Earth's atmosphere is not a uniform \"wall\" separating space from the Earth.  Instead, it is a thin layer of gas with a density that falls off with altitude.  As a result, even if you have a stable orbit at a low altitude, it is possible to eventually lose the orbit and fall back to Earth.  The International Space Station orbits at an altitude of about 400 kilometres.  However, [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orbiting_artificial_satellites_of_the_Soviet_Union_and_Russia) orbiting at altitudes of less than 100 kilometres are subject to re-entry within a few decades.  The [Hubble Space Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope) orbits at an altitude of about 550 kilometres.  It is currently subject to re-entry in about 2028.  [Skylab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylab), which orbited at an altitude of about 430 kilometres, re-entered the atmosphere in 1979.  Other objects, such as the [debris from a 2007 Chinese rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Chinese_anti-satellite_missile_test), are subject to re-entry at an altitude of 200 kilometres.\n\nComment: This is a great answer, thanks!  I think it may be interesting to point out that the ISS will probably not be operational forever, so if it were to lose orbit and fall to Earth, it would probably be lost anyway.\n\nComment: @MatthewRenzi the ISS is planned to be operational for at least another ten years, but I think you are correct that its de-orbit would be inevitable at some point.\n\nComment: @DaveRenfrew I think it's intended to be operational for about 20 years.  It has already been operational for more than 20 years.  In any case, it is not currently de-orbiting.  It is currently boosting its velocity.  As a result, it is increasing its altitude.  It will stay in orbit as long as it is boosted.  After that, it will eventually fall back to Earth.", "The space station is a satellite and needs to stay in orbit. The station needs to stay in orbit because the orbiting object is moving very fast (approximately 17,000 miles per hour) and if it slows it's speed it will come down to earth.\n\nJunk in orbit doesn't need to stay in orbit, it can be left there because it is already in orbit.\n\nAnswer: The space station is in orbit.  In order to maintain that orbit, it needs to move along the same path as the Earth's curvature.  This means that its speed has to exactly match the speed that the Earth is rotating at.  If it slows down, it will be slower than the Earth's rotation, and will fall back down to Earth.\n\nIf the space station slows down, it will stay in orbit for a little while, but when it eventually falls back down to Earth, it will be moving a lot faster than it needs to, so it will hit the ground hard.\n\nBut if you get rid of your junk in orbit, it will just fall back down to Earth.  It can take years to get up to space, but it only takes minutes or hours to fall back down to Earth.\n\nComment: Well, technically, it will be moving slower than the Earth's rotation, but it's still going to be moving fast enough that it's not going to fall back down to Earth.\n\nComment: @HDE226868 good point.  I meant to say that it would fall if it slows down, but I guess I didn't quite say that.\n\nAnswer: The simplest way to think about it is that the ISS is in a fixed, circular orbit around the Earth, and it needs to stay in that orbit. If it slows down, it will fall back to Earth.\n\nJunk objects are not in any particular orbit. They are just floating around. They can stay there for as long as they don't hit anything or get caught by another object's gravity well.", "Space station orbits are not necessarily stable.\n\nA space station is a \\em{man-made object in space} and is subject to the same forces as any other object in space.

A solar wind is a flow of electrically charged particles flowing outward from the Sun in all directions.\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind around the Earth, however this does not prevent the solar wind from exerting a force on objects in space.\n\n\\strong{The force exerted by the solar wind is called the [Poynting-Robertson effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect)}\n\n<IMAGE>\n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect is a force that causes an orbiting object to lose altitude and eventually crash into the Earth.\n\n\\section{Space Junk}\n\nAll objects in space are subject to the Poynting-Robertson effect and will slowly fall to Earth.\n\nHowever, since the Poynting-Robertson effect is a very small force, it takes a \\em{very long time} to cause an object to fall to Earth.\n\nIn fact, the Poynting-Robertson effect can be ignored for any object that is on a stable orbit.\n\n\\section{Space Station}\n\nSpace stations have to maintain their orbit, otherwise they will eventually fall to Earth due to the Poynting-Robertson effect.\n\n\\strong{This is exactly the same as any natural satellite orbiting the Earth.}\n\n\\section{Summary}\n\nThe force exerted by the solar wind is called the [Poynting-Robertson effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect).\n\nThis force slowly causes everything in space to fall towards the Earth.\n\nThe Poynting-Robertson effect is negligible for any object that is orbiting the Earth on a stable orbit.\n\nSpace stations need to maintain their orbit.\n\nSpace junk can stay up there indefinitely.\n\nComment: I am not sure why you are conflating space junk with satellites. You are essentially saying that the Poynting-Robertson effect is negligible for any object that is orbiting the earth on a stable orbit, and then you say that space junk can stay up there indefinitely, which is not necessarily true.\n\nComment: @DavidHammen: I am not confusing them. I am showing that any man made object orbiting the Earth will eventually crash into the Earth due to the Poynting-Robertson effect. It takes a very long time to cause an object to fall to Earth. In fact, the Poynting-Robertson effect can be ignored for any object that is on a stable orbit.\n\nComment: @DavidHammen: A piece of space junk in orbit is subject to the same forces as any other object in orbit.

But you are also saying that space junk can stay up there indefinitely. Those two statements contradict each other.\n\nComment: @DavidHammen: No they don't. The", "It actually has nothing to do with the fact that \"dangerous space junk\" is in a higher orbit.  As you correctly point out, that is actually a lower orbit, and the reason is that the space station is in a lower orbit.\n\nWhen the space shuttle goes up, it goes up to LEO (low earth orbit).  The space station is located in LEO, so it has to be in the same orbit.\n\nIf the space station was in geosynchronous orbit (GEO), then it wouldn't need to fire its rockets.  The space station is in LEO because it is easier and cheaper to get there.  A launch from LEO only needs to accelerate to about 7.8 km/s to get to GEO.  A launch from the ground needs to accelerate to 11.2 km/s.\n\nThe reason the space station is in LEO is because of the way rockets are designed and built.  The fuel is located on the bottom of the rocket, and you can only carry it in a certain amount of volume due to structural considerations.  LEO orbits are much closer to the ground, so the fuel needed to get there is much smaller.  A rocket in GEO would have to carry enough fuel to get to that orbit, and then expend that fuel to get to GEO.  It is much cheaper to launch a rocket in LEO that is much smaller, but then have to use the fuel in the rocket to get to GEO.\n\nComment: The space station is in LEO because of the same reason. The fuel is limited by its volume, so it is easier to lift it into LEO.\n\nComment: @Antzi:  You are correct.  I'll update my answer to reflect that.\n\nComment: The space station doesn't stay in LEO indefinitely, it needs to reboost its orbit regularly. The reason it doesn't need to do that in GEO is that it's in a 3-body orbit, not a 2-body orbit like LEO.\n\nComment: @Kevin:  That is correct.  I'll update the answer again to reflect that.\n\nComment: As a general rule, you should not edit answers to add new information, you should write a new answer.\n\nComment: @Kevin:  I don't see any reason to write a new answer.

It is not in orbit around the Earth.  It is in free fall around the Earth.\n\nFree fall is easy.  In free fall, you have no energy to do anything.  All you can do is fall.  The only thing you have to do is figure out what you want to fall towards.\n\nOrbits are not easy at all.  To be in orbit, you need to have an energy that is balanced with the energy lost from friction.  You need to keep using your engines to keep that energy up.  If you stop using your engines, you will fall.\n\nThis is why the space station is in free fall, but dangerous space junk can stay up there indefinitely.\n\nComment: I know they are in free fall.

There are hundreds of different scales, with different numbers of notes, different intervals between the notes, etc. There are scales that are used in different countries around the world, and there are scales that are specific to certain cultures or communities. There are scales used in Western music, and scales that are used in Eastern and other types of music.\n\nAnd there are scales that are used in different types of music. For example, there are scales that are used in classical music, scales that are used in jazz, scales that are used in rock, and so on.\n\n\\section{The \"Western\" scales}\n\nSome of the scales that are used in Western music are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale), which has 12 semitones (half-steps), and is often used in jazz and rock music.\n\\item The [major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale), which has 7 whole steps (whole notes) and 1 half step. This scale is often used in classical music, and in many Western popular styles.\n\\item The [minor scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_scale), which has 7 whole steps and 1 half step. This scale is used in classical music, and in many Western popular styles.\n\\item The [blues scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_scale), which has 6 whole steps and 1 half step. This scale is used in jazz, blues, rock, and many other styles.\n\\item The [pentatonic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic_scale), which has 5 whole steps and 2 half steps. This scale is used in many traditional styles, particularly in Eastern Asian and African music.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many different scales that are used in Western music.\n\n\\section{Why are there so many different scales?}\n\nThe answer to this question is not really simple. Different scales have been used for different reasons. For example, some scales are used because they are easier to play on certain instruments, while others are used because they sound good together.\n\nSome scales are used because they are associated with certain emotions or moods. For example, the major scale is often used to convey happiness, while the minor scale is often used to convey sadness.\n\nSome scales are used because they are associated with certain cultural traditions. For example, the pentatonic scale is often used in traditional Chinese music, while the blues scale is often used in traditional African American music.\n\nIn short, there are many different scales because they have been used for many different reasons.\n\n\\section{Why is the major scale so important?}\n\nThe major scale is important because it is the basis for many other scales. For example, the minor scale is just the major scale with one note lowered.\n\nThe major scale is also the basis for many chords. For example, the C major chord is just a C major scale played together.\n\nThe major scale is also the basis for many melodies. For example, the \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\" melody is just a C major scale played in a certain order.\n\nIn short, the major scale is important because it is the basis for many other scales, chords, and melodies.\n\n\\section{Why are there 12 notes in an octave?}\n\nThere are 12 notes in an octave because that is the way the human ear perceives sound. The human ear can perceive frequencies from 20 Hz (cycles per second) to 20,000 Hz. Above 20,000 Hz, the sound is too high for the human ear to perceive.\n\nThe human ear can also perceive intervals, or the difference between two notes. The smallest interval that the human ear can perceive is the semitone, which is a half step.\n\nWhen you play", "The number of keys in the scale comes from the number of tones in an octave.\n\nThe number of tones in an octave is a physical property of sound, and is determined by the frequency of the tone.  For a standard A440 tuning, the frequency of an A is 440Hz.  The frequency of the B that is an octave above the A is 880Hz.  The frequency of the C that is an octave above the B is 1760Hz.  And so on...\n\nIn the middle of the 18th century, musicians discovered that if you divided the octave into 12 equal parts, the frequency of each of those parts was a ratio of 1:2:4:8:16:32:64:128:256:512:1024:2048.  This ratio is called a just intonation.\n\n(In practice, the frequencies of notes in an A440 octave do not match perfectly these just intonation ratios, but they are pretty close.  The frequencies are determined by the length of the strings and other physical properties of the instrument).\n\nSince 12 is the smallest number of parts that can be divided into a 128:256:512:1024:2048 just intonation ratio, this gives us the 12 notes in the scale.  If you divide the octave into 20 parts, you get 12 more notes, but they are not in a just intonation ratio, and so they aren't considered to be part of the scale.\n\nTo get the major and minor scales, you take the notes which are 1:2:3:6:8 away from each other in the scale, and those are the notes of the major scale.  You take the notes which are 1:2:3:4:5:6 away from each other in the scale, and those are the notes of the minor scale.\n\nComment: I have a couple of followup questions:\n\n1. If you divide the octave into 20 parts, you get 12 more notes, but they are not in a just intonation ratio, and so they aren't considered to be part of the scale.  Why?\n\n2. If the notes are not in a just intonation ratio, how do we know what they are if they are not part of the scale?\n\n3. Is there a way to mathematically describe the notes in the scale?\n\nComment: The notes in the scale are those that are 1:2:3:6:8 away from each other in the scale, and those are the notes of the major scale.  You take the notes which are 1:2:3:4:5:6 away from each other in the scale, and those are the notes of the minor scale.\n\nComment: How do we know what the notes in the scale are?  You have to know what notes are in the major scale, and what notes are in the minor scale, and then you have to know the order they are in (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C).  Then you can count up the rest of the notes and figure out what they are (B-C#-D#-E#-F#-G#-A#-B).\n\nComment: I have another followup question: 1. How do we know what notes are in the major scale, and what notes are in the minor scale, and then you have to know the order they are in (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C)? 2. How is it that we know what those notes are?\n\nComment: 1. The notes of the major scale are the notes of the scale above the tonic.  The notes of the minor scale are the notes of the scale below the tonic.  A tonic is a note that is \"home\" to the major or minor scale.\n\nComment: If you have a C major scale, then the notes of the scale above the tonic are: C-D-E-F-G-A-B.  The notes of the scale below the tonic are: C#-D#-F#-G#-A#-B#-C#.\n\nComment: 2. Because they are defined in the music.  If you're playing a C major scale, then the notes are C-D-E-F-", "The chromatic scale is a series of tones.

The major keys are based on the white keys. Each major key has 3 minor keys.\n\nThe major keys are separated by a whole tone. This is why the major keys are divided into 7.\n\nThe minor keys are separated by a semitone. This is why the minor keys are divided into 5.\n\nComment: The original question is not about the chromatic scale, but about the major/minor scales.", "The [12-Tone Equal Temperament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-Tone_Equal_Temperament) is a scale that is based on the idea that each note in a scale must be the same distance apart from each other.\n\nIn the 12-Tone Equal Temperament, there are 12 notes, each 100 cents apart from each other.  A cent is the smallest unit of measurement of pitch, and there are 100 cents in a semitone.  So if you play a note a semitone higher or lower than another note, it will be one cent away from the other note.  The same reasoning applies for the other semitones, and there are 12 of them in the 12-Tone Equal Temperament, each one 100 cents away from each other.\n\nThe easiest way to see this is to take a piano and play every note in the scale, going from `C` to `B`, and then back from `B` to `C`.  The distance between each note will be 100 cents.  If you take a piano with a normal keyboard, the distance between each key will be 12 semi-tones, or 1200 cents, which is much too much of a distance between each note.  So if you play all the notes in a row, the whole scale will sound very 'off' and out of tune.  On a piano with a normal keyboard, the scale would go from `C` to `C#` to `D` to `D#` to `E` etc....\n\nThe 12-Tone Equal Temperament is used because it is the best compromise of 'musicality' and 'accuracy'.  The 12-Tone Equal Temperament gives every note in the scale the same distance apart, and makes the scale sound 'musical', but it also is accurate enough that if you play the notes in order on a piano, it will sound in tune.\n\nComment: I'm not sure about your claim that the 12-TET is the best compromise of musicality and accuracy.  If you can find a tuning that is more musically pleasing, and still as accurate, then that would be the best compromise.  But I don't know of such a tuning.\n\nComment: I think that the 12-Tone Equal Temperament is the best compromise because of the way the scale is designed.  In the 12-Tone Equal Temperament, each note is the same distance away from each other, so if you play them in order, it will sound in tune.  However, the 12-Tone Equal Temperament doesn't give each note an equal amount of 'tension', which is what makes some scales sound more 'musical' than others.  The 12-Tone Equal Temperament is the best compromise because it gives each note in a scale equal distance away from each other, and also gives each note an equal amount of tension.\n\nComment: @Kyle: There are hundreds of tunings that are more musically pleasing than the 12-TET.  For example, in any temperament with a pure fifth, the major third or minor third are out of tune.  Also, the 12-TET is very rough on the overtones, which causes many timbres to be less pleasant than they would be with a different tuning.\n\nComment: @supercat: I said that the 12-Tone Equal Temperament is the best compromise between accuracy and musicality.  I didn't say that any other tuning is more accurate or musical than the 12-Tone Equal Temperament.  It's just that the 12-Tone Equal Temperament is the best compromise between accuracy and musicality.\n\nComment: @Kyle: If one has a temperament that's musically pleasing, and still accurate, then one can adjust it to be even more accurate without losing its musicality.  In particular, if one has a pure fifth, one can adjust it to be a pure diapason fifth, which is a little more accurate.  Similarly, one can adjust the major or minor third to be a more accurate version of that interval.  Of course, it's not always possible to adjust such intervals to make them more accurate without making them less musical.", "Here is how I think of it.\n\nYou have a scale which is a series of notes arranged in increasing order of pitch. For example, for the key of C this would be the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and then back to C.\n\nEach note can be represented by a frequency. The note C, for example, is 261.63Hz. The note D is 293.66Hz and so on.\n\nThe notes in a scale can be grouped into two types - major and minor. The major notes have a \"happy\" feeling to them. The minor notes have a \"sad\" feeling to them.\n\nThe major notes have a frequency which is a multiple of a major interval. In other words, a frequency which is a multiple of a whole number.\n\nThe minor notes have a frequency which is a multiple of a minor interval. In other words, a frequency which is a multiple of some number with a fractional part.\n\nSo, for example, C is a major note. It has a frequency of 261.63Hz, which is a multiple of 3. (i.e. 3 x 87.21Hz)\n\nD is a minor note. It has a frequency of 293.66Hz, which is a multiple of 4/3. (i.e. 4/3 x 87.21Hz)\n\nThe major notes are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item C\n\\item D\n\\item E\n\\item F\n\\item G\n\\item A\n\\item B\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe minor notes are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item D\n\\item E\n\\item F\n\\item G\n\\item A\n\\item B\n\\item C\n\\end{itemize}\n\nYou can see that the major notes all have a multiple of 3 as their frequency and the minor notes all have a multiple of 4/3 as their frequency.\n\nSo, the scale of C major has the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C.\n\nThe scale of D minor has the notes D, E, F, G, A, B, C and D.\n\nThe scale of D major has the notes D, E, F#, G, A, B and C#.\n\nThe scale of D minor has the notes D, E, F, G, A, B, C and D.\n\nFor D major, we have the notes D, E, F#, G, A, B and C#. There are two new notes in the scale - the sharps, F# and C#.\n\nFor D minor, we have the notes D, E, F, G, A, B, C and D. There is just one new note in the scale - the flat, B flat.\n\nThe scales of different keys have different notes in them. This is why they are different.\n\nThe reason I think of it this way is that it helps me to remember the relationship between the different scales. For example, if I know that the scale of D major has the notes D, E, F#, G, A, B and C# I can easily work out what the scale of G major is. (G, A, B, C, D, E and F#)\n\nIf you know any music theory, you might be able to work out that the minor scales are just the major scales with the third, sixth and seventh notes flattened. This is a good thing to know because it means you can easily work out the minor scales from the major scales. (e.g. for the key of D major, the minor scale is D minor.)\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer: It's a good question. You are essentially asking why are there 12 tones in the octave. If you are asking why there are 7 major keys and 5 minor keys, then that is a different question.\n\nThe answer to the first question is historical. The reason is that in the early days of music, there were only 12 tones in the octave. For instance, in the Middle Ages, the lowest tone was written as C and the highest tone was written as C' (pronounced C prime). They also used 12 tones to the octave to help with singing. That is why we still use C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, and B in modern music.\n\nIf"]}

Because getting married isn't going to make anything better, it's just a piece of paper and a ring. If you're just looking for that, then don't get married. I don't think it will help you any.\n\nSecond, if you do want to spend the rest of your life with this person, then you need to know that no matter what you do, this person will never be perfect and that's OK. You are both going to change, things are going to change, and you need to be OK with that. If you can't accept that, then maybe you should just break up.\n\nThird, if you do decide that you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, you need to be very careful about who you marry, because you can't just walk out of a marriage whenever you feel like it. You'll need to be very sure that this is the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, because if you're not, then you're making a commitment that you can't walk away from.\n\nFourth, if you do decide that you want to spend the rest of your life with this person, then you need to accept the fact that you might have to sacrifice some of your desires for the sake of your marriage. If you can't do that, then maybe you should just break up.\n\nAnswer: My advice:  If you really want to be together, then make the effort to see each other every day, even if it's just a quick visit to catch up.  If you can't do that, then the relationship is not strong enough to survive the everyday pressures of life.\n\nAnswer: My advice:\n\n\\em{\\strong{If you are not happy, why are you married?}}\n\nAnswer: Get a divorce.", "You're right.

The Romans also greeted each other by kissing the hand of the person they were greeting.  In fact, the Roman greeting \"Salve\" (Hello) was actually a kissing gesture.\n\nThe Romans spread this practice across Europe, and even the English adopted the practice of kissing on the cheek (with the right cheek being presented to the other person).  The French, on the other hand, kissed each other on the lips.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWe don\u2019t know when the Romans first kissed each other as a greeting, but we do know that by the time of the poet Virgil (70\u201319 BC), it was a commonplace.

In some cultures, it is still not considered appropriate. However, there are indications that the practice was widespread in ancient times.\n\n### Ancient Egypt\n\nThe ancient Egyptians are believed to have been the first to use kissing as a sign of affection. According to the book \"On the Trail of the Neanderthals\", by Chris Stringer, the ancient Egyptians used kissing as a way to express love and friendship. In ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, the image of two people kissing is often seen. This indicates that kissing was an accepted form of affection in ancient Egypt.\n\n### Ancient Greece\n\nIn ancient Greece, kissing was also a common form of affection. According to the book \"The Art of Love: An Ancient Guide to the Art of Seduction,\" by Ovid, the ancient Greeks believed that kissing was a way to express love and affection. Kissing was seen as a form of intimacy and was often used as a way to show affection between couples.\n\n### Ancient Rome\n\nIn ancient Rome, kissing was also seen as a form of affection. According to the book \"The Roman World: A Social and Cultural History,\" by E. S. Gruen, the ancient Romans believed that kissing was a way to express love and affection.

My grandmother passed away and left me her house.  I should have talked to her before the house was sold.\n\nAnswer: There is nothing you can do.  You are not a victim here.  You were an heir to your grandmother's estate.  The legal relationship between you and your grandmother is determined by the will.  In a will, the person making the will (Grandma in this case) is called the testator.  The person who is getting the benefits of the will (usually all the beneficiaries) is called the beneficiary.\n\nYou are a beneficiary.  Your father is not.  If you don't like the will, you can challenge it based on one of a few grounds.  If you were not told there was a will, you could challenge it for undue influence.  If there was no will, then you would inherit according to the laws of intestacy of your state.  If your grandmother had no will, then you would inherit the house because you would be considered the next of kin.\n\nSo the bottom line is, you have no recourse.\n\nComment: In California, you can't challenge the will for undue influence.\n\nComment: @Charles: that is correct.  There are only three grounds for a will contest.  Undue influence is not one of the three grounds.\n\nComment: @Charles: I was confused.  I thought you were in California.\n\nAnswer: \\em{Is there anything I can do?}\n\nIf you can prove that your father was incompetent, you can file a lawsuit to set aside the sale of the house, and to put the house back in your father's name.\n\nBut if your father was perfectly competent, he can do whatever he wants with the house.\n\nAnswer: If your grandmother left her house to you and your father (and you), then you and your father are the beneficiaries of the estate.  If your father sold the house and kept all the money for himself, that is perfectly legal.  (I assume he has power of attorney to act for you as well?)\n\nIf you did not consent to the sale, then you can file a lawsuit against your father for the money.  But unless he did something criminal, you won't get it."]}

I have upvoted and accepted your answer.", "There is no absolute rule that all people must die out because of inbreeding.\n\nThe effects of inbreeding are not limited to the fertility of a population, but include other traits. For example, the offspring of related individuals might be more susceptible to certain diseases, or less intelligent. Individuals who reproduce more than their relatives might survive better, and the genetic diversity of the population might increase as a result.\n\nSo, it is possible that some individuals might survive better than their relatives. They might be better at avoiding predators, and thus more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes.\n\nOf course, these effects might be limited. For example, if the tribe is very small, and everybody is related, it is less likely that there is a big variation in fitness. In this case, the tribe might die out if they are unable to adapt to their environment.\n\nComment: The inbreeding effects are not limited to fertility, but include other traits. For example, the offspring of related individuals might be more susceptible to certain diseases, or less intelligent. Individuals who reproduce more than their relatives might survive better, and the genetic diversity of the population might increase as a result.\n\nAnswer: There are two ways to address this.\n\nFirst, consider that if there is a way to avoid inbreeding, inbreeding is not a problem. So if people don't die out, there's a way to avoid it.\n\nSecond, if we assume that there is a way to avoid inbreeding, there are \\em{many} ways to avoid inbreeding. So the tribe can simply find one of those ways.\n\nE.g., 1000 years ago, if all of the people from your tribe wanted to marry someone from the neighbouring tribe, they wouldn't be able to do so. That's because there is not enough space to fit both tribes. But if one of the tribes dies out, then the other tribe can grow.\n\nSo if you want to know how to avoid inbreeding, you have to choose one of the many ways to avoid inbreeding.\n\nComment: Thanks, I didn't know there were so many ways to avoid inbreeding.", "They marry their cousins.\n\nComment: Please look up the term \"inbreeding\".\n\nComment: @SidharthBhatia: I think that if you look up \"cousins\" on the same page, you'll find out that they're not the same thing.\n\nComment: @SidharthBhatia: I wonder what your objection is.

They don't all live together in one village.  The tribe usually covers an area of several square kilometers, and the various villages are hundreds of kilometers apart.  They trade, travel, and communicate with the other villages.\n\nComment: I've edited the question to reflect this.\n\nComment: I've downvoted this answer because you're wrong.\n\nAnswer: I think that you're mistaken on the definition of \"inbreeding\".  The term is used to describe the mating of close relatives.  \"Inbreeding\" doesn't mean \"not marrying outside the tribe\", it means \"marrying someone who is closely related by blood\".  You can do the former without doing the latter.  It's quite possible that tribes like the ones you describe have a long history of marrying cousins, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're all related to each other.\n\nComment: I've edited the question to reflect this.\n\nAnswer: It's not a problem, particularly if there is an extended family structure.  In a society where, for example, all the males of a clan are brothers, brothers often marry sisters.  This allows the clan to retain a good deal of its genetic diversity.\n\nComment: I've edited the question to reflect this.\n\nAnswer: I'm sure that this is a well-understood phenomenon, but I'm not sure what the answer is.  I think that, in general, it would be very easy for them to die out.  However, by your own description, they don't; they thrive.\n\nTo answer your question, it seems to me that the most likely answer is that there are a relatively small number of these \"tribes,\" and they are all interconnected by trade and intermarriage.  This way, when a tribe dies out, they can be replaced by a new tribe from one of the others.  So, in the long run, the population of tribes stays fairly constant.\n\nFor example, suppose that there are one thousand such tribes.  Each tribe dies out every 200 years, on average.  This means that the population of tribes is replaced once every 1,000 years (i.e., on average, one new tribe will be formed every year).  So, these tribes won't die out.  They might become less numerous, and there might be less genetic diversity, but neither of those things would be enough to kill the tribes off.  The genetic diversity is reduced because the tribes are, on average, half the size that they would be if they were completely unrelated.  But, a reduction in genetic diversity by a factor of two is not enough to make the tribes die off, so there must be a lot more tribes than that.", "\\begin{blockquote}\nHow do remote tribes that have no new genetic material for thousands of years not die out because of inbreeding?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSimple. Because they are not the same tribe. Because as long as the tribe is isolated in an area that is not connected to the world, they can not mix with other tribes, so there is no inbreeding.\n\nFor example, the Australian Aborigines. They are the same people as the people of Papua New Guinea. But if you look at the DNA of an Australian Aborigine and a Papua New Guinean, it is not the same.\n\nWhy? Because when the Australian Aborigines and the Papua New Guineans were one tribe, they split, and they did not mix with each other.\n\nIt is exactly the same with all the tribes. They are all isolated in their own little areas. Until they mix, they are not the same tribe.\n\nComment: What does \"simple\" mean?\n\nComment: I don't want to be a jerk, but it is not exactly clear what you mean.

Sometimes this is the most important aspect. Forcing someone to change their password is a very good way to let them know that their account has been compromised. If you take that opportunity to let them know that they should change their password on their other accounts, that's the best security you can provide them.\n\nComment: I've added a fourth point to the list: it forces people to use stronger passwords, since they have to remember them.\n\nComment: @Dave: I've seen plenty of people use the same password on every account before a forced change.

If you are trying to protect against an outsider, then it probably will.  If you are trying to protect against an insider, then it probably won't.  An insider will likely have the password written down somewhere, and just change it before someone notices.\n\nAnswer: I think the forced password expiration is an attempt to make the password more secure.  If someone is using an easily guessable password, they will likely change it on their own in a short period of time.  By forcing the password change, you are trying to make sure that the password is changed before the user is hacked.\n\nAnswer: I don't think it does.\n\nI've never seen a scenario where an attacker has compromised the password (or any other part) of a user account.  All the attacks I have seen are directed at the server / network / database.\n\nHowever, if there is an actual case where an attacker has compromised a password, then there is a good chance that the attacker has also compromised the password reset mechanism, in which case the attacker can reset the password as many times as they like.", "The whole concept has been thoroughly debunked: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/211/is-it-better-to-have-a-long-password-or-a-short-password-with-a-very-complex-passw\n\nAnswer: Yes it does help.\n\nIf there is a breach of any of your password systems, attackers will have a finite amount of time to take advantage of the access.  If you have only one password, an attacker can take his time and brute force it.  However, if a password system is compromised and you have a 3-6 month system, the attacker has a limited window of time to try and exploit the access.\n\nComment: So even if the attacker has a copy of your password, you're still safe?\n\nComment: If you're talking about having a copy of your password in plain text, no.

Even if the attacker has the password in plain text, they still only have a finite amount of time.\n\nAnswer: Yes, it helps.\n\nA hacker can't use the password to login to a system if he doesn't know what the password is.

There is 2-factor authentication, for example.\n\nAnswer: Passwords stored in plain text in a database are not safe. If the attacker has the password, he can break into your system anytime.\n\nIf the password is in hashed form, the attacker needs to brute force the password. For example, if the password was `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, it would require 3.75 billion guesses to break the hash. On the other hand, if the password is `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1`, it would only take 1 billion guesses to break the hash.\n\nThe problem with hashed passwords is that the hashed password and the original password are not stored in the same place. So, if the database is breached, the attacker can't break in by using the hashed passwords. He needs to break in by using the plain text password.\n\nAnswer: Passwords are just one part of the whole security concept. If you have an application which stores passwords in the clear or uses weak hashes, it is trivial to crack the password by brute force.\n\nIn addition to changing the password, you should use a secure hash and a salt. If the password is hashed and salted, you can only recover it when you have the hash and the salt.\n\nIf you change the hash every 3-6 months, you will make it harder for a hacker to recover the password. But it is also important to change the salt.\n\nComment: I don't think the answer is clear. It seems to be saying that a password is only good as long as the password is not stolen.", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nDoes forcing people (employees, customers, etc.) to change their password every 3-6 months really help with security?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThe reason that people have to change passwords is because of the history of poor password management.\n\nThe security problem has been that people used to use the same password for multiple accounts (like their bank account, their work account, their email account, etc.)\n\nBut, people just couldn't remember all those different passwords, so they made their password really simple.  Like their wife's maiden name, or their address, or their date of birth.  Then they used the same password for multiple accounts.  That means that if someone figured out your password, they could access multiple accounts.\n\nSo, they made people change their password every 3-6 months.  The hope was that people would keep a different password for each account.  But, people just changed the last digit of their password.  Now they use their wife's maiden name, like \"Smith10\".  Then they used the same password for multiple accounts.\n\nThat's why they invented the \"password strength meter\".  It is an attempt to educate people to make a password that is long, and has many different characters (upper and lower case, numbers, symbols, etc.).  But, people still use the same password for multiple accounts.  And, they still change it every 3-6 months.\n\nThe way to fix this is to have a password policy that requires long, complex, unique passwords (maybe 10+ characters long, with at least 3 different types of characters).  But, you don't want to enforce changing passwords every 3-6 months.  Because of the history of password management, people will just do what they did before.  So, you have to educate them.  Tell them why they need to change.  And, give them tools to help them.\n\nI personally use a password manager (Lastpass) that generates a very long, unique password, with multiple different characters.

The shortage areas are listed in the [2012-13 version of the studentship offer](http://www.hefce.ac.uk/funding/postgrad/2012/201213/201213A_PhD_Applicant_Guidance.pdf).\n\nComment: I'm in the U.S. - I've edited the post to clarify.\n\nComment: If you do find any such programs (for the US), they may be funded by the NSF: see http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2003/nsf03059/nsf03059.htm and http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2011/nsf11562/nsf11562.pdf\n\nAnswer: I'm in the US so I can't speak about the UK situation, but here the answer is absolutely yes.  In my department, for instance, they have a need for graduate students in applied econometrics (a.k.a. applied statistics).  See for instance [this](http://www.econjobrumors.com/topic/2013-economics-phd-applications-discussions) post from econjobrumors.  (That's an econ PhD applicants thread; there are others for other fields.)  And I can personally vouch for this, as I am a second year applied econometrics PhD student.\n\nMy field is much smaller than other fields in economics, and in the department I'm in, there is no shortage of people trying to get in.  But in other departments, there may be a shortage of people trying to get in, and they may be desperate to get a good student.  It's worth looking into.\n\nAnswer: The short answer is no.\n\nThe longer answer is that while there are some areas that have more applicants than available positions, there are also many areas where there are way more positions than applicants. The latter is especially true at the top 50 universities.\n\nFor example, my department has 7 PhD students this year, and we're not even close to being done with admissions. I don't know how many more we're going to take, but I'm guessing it's 4 or 5. We are a top 50 department, and the same is true for a lot of our friends at other top 50 departments.", "I have this same problem in my department, so I have some experience trying to solve it.\n\nThe key is to \\strong{find out what makes the job attractive to people}. In our case, it's a combination of the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Good salary (in Belgium)\n\\item Good working conditions (a nice campus with a nice canteen)\n\\item Very little teaching (the workload is low)\n\\item A lot of freedom (everything is optional, so if you don't feel like writing a paper, you don't need to)\n\\item Good colleagues (people that are very supportive of each other)\n\\item Good students (they are nice to deal with, and they don't give you any trouble)\n\\item Enough research funding (so you don't need to worry about financing your research)\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{And the most important thing:} the department is very supportive if you want to have a family.  If you can't find a job where all of these are true, you can always have a job where some of these are true, and that is still much better than a job where none of these are true.\n\nComment: All of these are true.  I've just started a postdoc position in Belgium, and I'm very happy with how the job is set up.  I have very little teaching, plenty of research time, and I'm surrounded by like-minded colleagues who are supportive of each other.\n\nComment: This is the most important thing for me. I've had a lot of opportunities to pursue a tenure track position in the last few years, but I've never taken them because they've all been at departments with untenable workloads.\n\nComment: I don't know if this is true in Belgium, but one thing that I was told about Belgian universities is that they have no tenure track positions.  I don't know the details, but I think this means that you're always working under the assumption that you might lose your job at any time.  Is there any truth to this?\n\nComment: That's right.  If you're not hired as a permanent employee, you'll get fired after 5 years.  It can be a bit scary if you're not sure how things are going to go, but it's not so bad when you're in a good department.\n\nComment: In my experience, the key is to find a university that has good research funding.  The salary and working conditions can vary greatly from one school to another.\n\nAnswer: \\strong{Not at all,} the situation is actually dire.  There are many positions out there that are not being filled.  I have a friend who is looking for a postdoc position and is having trouble finding one.  The problem isn't just in the US, it's worldwide.\n\n[This article](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6002/322.full.pdf) describes the situation in the US:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe data presented above suggest that the future\n  of higher education research is bleak. For\n  universities, the problem is twofold:\n  finding and keeping promising faculty\n  members in an increasingly competitive\n  global marketplace, and filling research\n  positions with qualified persons. The\n  problem for the researchers is to get\n  and keep a job in a time when the\n  number of jobs is shrinking, and the\n  job market is becoming increasingly\n  global.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: I think that article is a bit out of date.  It's true that the number of jobs has gone down, but the number of people looking for jobs has gone down as well.  I've been in interviews where the faculty were very happy to meet me, because they've had a hard time finding good candidates for the last few years.\n\nComment: There are some disciplines where there is a shortage of people looking for jobs.  However, there are other disciplines where there is an over abundance of people looking for jobs.  I would not say that the overall situation is dire.\n\nComment: In the US, at least, the problem is acute in certain fields and not so much in others.  My friend's field is particularly bad because people are getting PhDs and are unable to find", "I think the question is more about the nature of the academic environment than a question about academic fields.\n\nI'm guessing that every field has a few people who are trying to teach. The problem is that it is very difficult to find tenure track positions in any of these fields. So if you are a new PhD in some of these fields you might have a hard time finding a job.\n\nIn some fields there are a lot more PhDs than there are tenure track positions. Thus it is extremely competitive to get into those fields.\n\nIn other fields there are fewer PhDs than there are tenure track positions. Thus it is easier to get a job in those fields.\n\nThe problem is that people want to study things that they enjoy studying. Thus they tend to go into the fields where there are tenure track positions.\n\nThus the problem is not that there are not enough people trying to teach but rather that there are not enough tenure track positions.\n\nComment: Are you saying that the people who are in the \"no tenure track jobs\" fields are not really trying to teach?  Or that there are not enough people trying to teach in those fields?\n\nComment: @Matt I'm saying that there are not enough tenure track positions in those fields.\n\nAnswer: I think a large part of the issue is that universities have become big businesses, and they think of their students as customers who can choose to go elsewhere.  So they are not going to hire more people unless they have a lot of students, and they are not going to invest in more training unless it results in more students.  The current economic climate is also a big factor.  If we were in a time of prosperity, it would be much easier to get more funding to hire more teachers.\n\nComment: The money is there for the hires, but the hires aren't happening. It is not a matter of not having money available but rather a matter of not having a pool of qualified candidates.\n\nComment: @BrianBorchers - that is true, but it is also true that the universities are not doing enough to make themselves more attractive to those candidates - whether that means better pay or better working conditions.  I'm not saying it is the whole story, but I do think it is a significant part of the story.\n\nComment: I agree. The universities will need to start offering higher wages and better working conditions to attract more qualified candidates.\n\nAnswer: I think it is a combination of demand and supply. There is a lot of demand but not enough supply.\n\nThe demand is created by the fact that so many parents want their children to go to college. In order to meet this demand, the US has a lot of colleges and universities.\n\nThe supply problem is created by the fact that 90% of all academic jobs are tenure track. Very few non-tenure track jobs exist and these are mainly Adjunct positions. Thus we have a huge number of PhDs who are not getting tenure track jobs and thus they are not entering the teaching field.\n\nThus the problem is not there are not enough people trying to teach but rather there are not enough tenure track positions.\n\nComment: I think it's also important to note that colleges are incentivized to hire adjuncts because they cost much less.  But a person with a PhD who wants to teach is not going to settle for being an adjunct, so that's why there's a problem with a shortage of people teaching.\n\nComment: @BrianBorchers - I think the problem is that there are not enough tenure track positions but that this is driven by the fact that so many people have PhDs.\n\nComment: I think the problem is that there are not enough tenure track positions, but it's also the case that there are not enough people trying to teach.  There are a lot of people who have PhDs but don't want to teach.", "For a starting professor, the most difficult courses to teach are the ones you are not familiar with.  If you are not familiar with the material, you will have to spend more time reading and preparing.  So you will have to decide how much teaching you want to do.  If you are teaching only one class, you can devote more time to preparation if you want.  If you are teaching several classes, you might not want to take on new classes that you are not familiar with.\n\nComment: This is what I would have said, too - I'm not sure why you got a downvote.\n\nAnswer: It depends a lot on the department. I've seen ads that say, \"We are looking for a candidate who will be able to teach the following courses:...blah blah blah...\" So they are looking for someone who can teach a given course. Other times they say, \"We are looking for someone who can teach the following courses:...blah blah blah...and is willing to teach the following courses:...blah blah blah...\" So they want someone who is willing to teach something in addition to what they are willing to teach.\n\nA lot of the time, it will just be a matter of whether you are able to teach a course that is already in the curriculum. But if you are asked to teach a course that is not already in the curriculum, you will have to work with the department chair to get it approved if you have not already done so for the position you are applying for.\n\nAnswer: In my experience, it's rare that a job description will specify \\em{exactly} what you'll be teaching.  My impression is that most departments are willing to let you pick your own courses, so long as they are in the general area of your expertise.  The exception is if your research is in a very specific subfield, because it's unlikely that you have a lot of experience teaching a wide range of courses.  In that case, your department may ask you to teach a particular course, probably the one that most closely matches your research.\n\nComment: This is what I've seen as well. I've had a fair amount of flexibility in what I've taught. I've also seen that flexibility in other departments. The only exception I've seen is if you have *extremely* specialized knowledge, as in the case of a historian who was asked to teach a course on a single battle.", "There is a shortage of STEM professors in the US.  I have heard the same from my colleagues in physics.  It seems to be particularly severe in the northeast, where I am.  The shortage is probably related to the demographic changes in the US.  There are fewer Americans of the 'Baby Boom' generation, and fewer Americans who are willing to become professors.  The number of PhDs in physics has been increasing, but not as fast as the number of new faculty positions.\n\nComment: This is my understanding.  In my experience, there are many more PhDs than faculty positions in many STEM fields, and the number of PhDs has been growing faster than the number of faculty positions for a long time.  The shortage of faculty at the lower levels is only a problem because of the shortage of PhDs in the past.\n\nComment: I don't think the shortage is due to the lack of people trying to become professors, but rather the lack of positions available.\n\nComment: @F'x:  The number of positions is limited by the number of PhDs coming out.  For example, the number of physics PhDs per year has been increasing by about 4% per year for the last 40 years.  Meanwhile the number of faculty positions has been increasing by about 1.5% per year.  So it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that there are more people trying to become professors than there are positions available.  Of course there are other factors at play, and the number of professors is not solely determined by the number of PhDs, but it is certainly an important factor.\n\nComment: @F'x:  That said, I have no idea why the number of PhDs has been increasing so rapidly.  It seems to be a consequence of the Baby Boom, which will have decreased by the time the PhDs enter the job market.  But I don't know what the trend is likely to be over the next few decades, as the Baby Boomers retire.\n\nAnswer: In the UK, there is a shortage of [Mathematics lecturers](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404246.article) and in particular in the [East Midlands](http://www.wrexham.ac.uk/news/11062012-maths-teacher-shortage.html).  There are also [current vacancies](http://www.mathsjobs.org.uk/vacancies/uk/) for academic maths posts in the UK.\n\nAnswer: In France, there is a shortage of PhDs in the humanities and social sciences (see http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/debat/des-licences-en-science-de-l-homme-et-de-la-societe-a-la-vente-344665.html)\n\nIt is not only due to the lack of students but also to the fact that the PhDs are not well paid (see http://www.letudiant.fr/educpros/debat/les-phds-en-science-de-l-homme-et-de-la-societe-se-recrutent-mal-343581.html)\n\nComment: The links are only in French, could you summarize the key points in English?\n\nComment: @F'x, I have corrected my post, I hope it is clear now.\n\nComment: The first link is to a French-language newspaper.

You try to prevent them from building nests near places where people live.\n\nThis was done in a variety of ways. If you lived in a house, you would try to seal up any cracks where a hornet could enter. You would also try to avoid having garbage, which tends to attract insects, near your house.\n\nIf you lived in a barn or other outbuilding, you would try to keep the roof in good repair, and the doors and windows closed, so that the hornets would not enter.\n\nIf a hornet does enter your house or barn, you would try to kill it. Insects have been around for hundreds of millions of years and have evolved a variety of defenses. Wiping a hornet with a fly swatter won't work, because a hornet will be able to fly away. If there is a nest near your home, you may need to use more sophisticated methods, such as a bumblebee trap, which uses lights to attract the hornets, which then fall into a bucket of water.\n\nThere were also a variety of plants which were used to repel insects. For example, if you lived in a place where there was a lot of mosquitoes, you would try to have lots of catnip plants, which repel mosquitoes.\n\nFinally, I'll note that most people do not like to kill hornets. They are beneficial insects which help to pollinate plants. Their nests are also used by humans for materials. People will often keep hornets away from their property by building barriers around their houses, so that hornets will be kept away from them, but won't be killed.\n\nComment: Thank you. So, your answer is that if you can't avoid hornets, you try to kill them?\n\nComment: That is one way. Another way is to try to avoid them. But it is difficult to avoid hornets. Hornets live in a variety of places, such as barns and trees.\n\nComment: But if you kill a hornet, it's dead. If you avoid a hornet, it's probably not dead.\n\nComment: Yes, but if you can't avoid a hornet, you have to kill it.\n\nComment: Let us [continue this discussion in chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/134261/discussion-between-snow-and-user12).\n\nComment: @user12: The most important factor in how many hornets we see today is the fact that there are so many humans around.

It is a beautiful insect, and when kept in captivity it is very friendly.\n\n\\em{It learns to recognize its friends and associates and will distinguish between human beings, dogs and cats, and other animals.}\n\nIt will also distinguish between a good man who is kind to it, and one who is not. It will not sting an individual who treats it kindly, but it will sting with a vengeance any one who does not treat it with due respect.\n\nThe hornet is an insect that, like some of the higher orders of animals, is capable of learning. The first thing to do is to teach it to feed at your hand. To accomplish this, provide a small jar in which to feed the insect.\n\nThe first step is to take a long, narrow glass tube, and fill it with sugar water. The tube should be placed in the jar, and the insect should be given to the tube to feed itself.\n\nIf you put your finger in the jar, the insect will at first think that it is a stinging insect, and will attempt to sting you.\n\nBut after a few days of feeding, it will become accustomed to you, and will not even attempt to sting you.

There are only insecticides that have been invented that have a good cost-benefit ratio.  When that ratio changes, the insecticide is abandoned or replaced.\n\nThe earliest insecticides were poisons that were extracted from plants, and they were used to poison insects.  The Egyptians used them.  The Greeks knew about them.  The Romans used them.  The Chinese used them.  The Indians used them.  The Aztecs used them.  They knew that a toxic bark could be used to kill insects.  As long as the insects were more valuable dead than alive, they used it.\n\nAs far as I know, there were no insecticides that were invented that were harmful to humans, and then abandoned because they were harmful.  There is a long history of insecticides that were invented and used, then abandoned because they were not cost effective.  For some insecticides, the cost effectiveness changed over time, and they were re-invented to be used again.\n\nInsecticides are used in large quantities, and it is a good idea to know that they are safe when used in the recommended amounts.  For that reason, insecticides are extensively tested before they are allowed to be sold for public use.  The insecticides that have been invented have been extensively tested, and they have been shown to be safe when used in the recommended amounts.  There are no insecticides that have been invented that have not been extensively tested, and there are no insecticides that have been invented that have been found to be harmful to humans, but they have been used anyway.\n\nThe insecticides that have been invented are not used indiscriminately.  They are used carefully and prudently.  They are used in the recommended amounts.  They are used in a way that minimizes the risk that they will cause harm to humans.

Your children would grow up without a parent.\n\nThere are also many other people in the world who would be affected if you committed suicide. For example, if you are a doctor or nurse, then your suicide would mean that there are now less doctors and nurses in the world. If you are a teacher, then your suicide would mean that there are now less teachers in the world.\n\nThe point is that your suicide would affect many other people in the world. If you commit suicide, then you are taking away the life of another person. It is not your life to take away.\n\nSo, society should not let someone commit suicide.\n\nComment: I'm not saying that it is right to forbid it, but that it is not wrong to forbid it either. I'm not saying I think it should be forbidden, but I don't think it should be allowed either. I think it's a matter of personal choice.\n\nComment: @DavidK: Society doesn't forbid suicide. Society does things like try to stop people from committing suicide. By saying that suicide is wrong, you are saying that society should try to stop people from committing suicide. You can't say that society should try to stop people from committing suicide and then say \"But I don't think it should be forbidden either\". It is forbidden.\n\nComment: @DavidK: Also, it is not a matter of personal choice. It is a matter of the wants and desires of others. If you commit suicide, then you are taking away the life of another person. It is not your life to take away.\n\nComment: That's not really correct. The idea of personal choice is that you can choose to do something or not. The society can make it difficult, but ultimately it is your choice. Society doesn't make laws because it is absolutely necessary. It does so because it thinks it's a good idea. So, if society thinks it's a good idea to forbid suicide, it shouldn't be forbidden, but if society thinks it's a bad idea, it shouldn't be forbidden either.\n\nComment: @DavidK: That's not what the idea of personal choice means. The idea of personal choice means that you can do what you want, as long as it doesn't infringe on the rights of others. The idea of personal choice does not mean that you can do what you want, even if it infringes on the rights of others.\n\nComment: It's a matter of perspective. One person's rights are another person's privileges.\n\nComment: @DavidK: You are correct. It is a matter of perspective. I just think that it is a matter of the wrong perspective.\n\nComment: So, you think that it's wrong to forbid suicide because it's wrong to infringe on the rights of others, but you think that it's wrong to forbid suicide because you think that suicide is wrong?\n\nComment: @DavidK: I don't think that it is wrong to forbid suicide because I think that suicide is wrong.

In the second case, I am actively helping him to do as he likes.\n\nI'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's my take on it.\n\nComment: I think this is a much better answer than mine.\n\nAnswer: The difference is, that in the first case, the person is the initiator of the action. In the second case, the person is reacting to the initiated action of someone else.\n\nSuicide is a crime of the first degree in the state of New Jersey (N.J.S. 2C:11-5) and carries the death penalty there.\n\n\"Assisting a suicide\" is not a state crime.

In NJ, aiding and abetting a suicide is a crime. There is no statute criminalizing assisting a suicide, the idea behind assisted suicide is that you help someone who wants to kill themselves.\n\nComment: @user6726 \"Aiding and abetting a suicide\" refers to a crime under federal law. NJ is one of the few states that criminalizes it.\n\nComment: @user6726: Assisting suicide is a state crime in most states. See, for example, California Penal Code \u00a7 401(a): \"Any person who knowingly and willfully advises, encourages, or assists another to commit suicide, or to take the life of another, or to commit murder is guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for 5 years.\"\n\nComment: @user6726: The fact that a state has criminalized assisted suicide does not mean that the state has criminalized \"aiding and abetting a suicide\". For example, the crime of assisted suicide in California is a felony, while the federal crime of \"aiding and abetting a suicide\" is a misdemeanor.\n\nComment: @user6726: The crime of assisted suicide is not an \"offense\". It is a crime. There is no reason why the crime of aiding and abetting a suicide would be different from the crime of assisted suicide.\n\nComment: This is just a guess, but I think that the distinction is that aiding and abetting a suicide is a crime under federal law, and assisted suicide is not a crime, but rather a non-criminal action.\n\nComment: @user6726: I'm not sure what you're getting at. I don't understand the distinction you're trying to make.\n\nComment: The distinction is that assisted suicide, is a legal action, and one that is allowed in certain states, and aiding and abetting a suicide, is a criminal action, under federal law.\n\nComment: @user6726: I'm not sure I understand the distinction you're making. I don't see any difference between the two crimes.\n\nComment: In the case of aiding and abetting a suicide, it is not legal.

The only difference is how the cuts are marketed.  For example, in the US, the most popular cut of beef is the T-Bone, which is the strip loin and the tenderloin.  In the UK, the most popular cut of beef is the Sirloin.  The difference is that the T-Bone is cut at a 45 degree angle to the backbone, whereas the Sirloin is cut parallel to the backbone.

The way you butcher is based on cultural traditions, and what part of the animal you can source.\n\nA good example is lamb. Lambs are traditionally butchered with the neck still attached, but in countries where the lamb is brought to the abattoir whole, the neck is detached. This is because the neck is a very valuable part of the animal for a lot of culinary traditions.\n\nIn parts of Eastern Europe, pigs are butchered in a way that the ribs are cut off the carcass still attached to the spine. This is because a lot of soups there require the ribs to be removed with the spine attached.\n\nIn the US, lambs are butchered with the neck detached because the neck is a valuable part of the animal for some but not all culinary traditions. The American and German way of butchering is very similar, and both butcher lambs the same way.\n\nIn the UK, the butchers often remove the neck from the carcass because most customers don't want it, but the neck is used for a lot of culinary traditions there.\n\nFor most cultures with a traditional butchering tradition, the meat will be butchered in a way that is adapted to the cultural traditions. Many people like to cook with the neck, so it's not removed from the carcass, for example.\n\nComment: This is very interesting. I've never seen a lamb with the neck still attached. I wonder if it's just because I'm not used to seeing it that way. I've seen the spine removed from the ribs, but I've never seen the ribs attached to the spine.

It is the same as \"What is the purpose of life\" or \"What is the point of life\".\n\nThe question is a philosophical question because it is so broad, and it is not likely to be answered by a mathematics or science answer. The question is essentially \"Why are we here?\" or \"What is the goal of life?\" or \"What is the goal of the universe?\" or \"What is the purpose of the universe?\".\n\nAnswer: The meaning of life is to find meaning.\n\nComment: I like this answer.\n\nAnswer: I think the first thing to understand is that we are not looking for a single answer. What is the meaning of life is a very vague question. It might mean the meaning of your life, it might mean the meaning of human existence. Perhaps it might even mean the meaning of existence itself.\n\nSo, there will be many different answers, depending on the question. In the case of your life, you might say that the meaning is to find the meaning. If you are looking for a philosophical answer, you might argue that the meaning is to enjoy the meaning.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer.  I'm hoping for a philosophical or religious answer.\n\nComment: The meaning of life is to find meaning?  That's circular reasoning.\n\nComment: No, it is not. You can find meaning without having to look for it.\n\nComment: If you find meaning without looking for it, then what's the point of looking for it?  If you find meaning without looking for it, then you aren't looking for it.\n\nComment: The point is to find the meaning of life. If it is given to you, you will look for it. If you don't find it, you will spend your life looking for it.\n\nComment: So, you're saying that you need to find meaning in order to find it?  So, if you don't ever find meaning, you'll just keep looking for it?  That makes no sense.\n\nComment: I am saying that if you find meaning without looking for it, you will not spend your life looking for it. You might spend some time looking for it, but when you find it, you will stop looking for it and just enjoy it.\n\nComment: That makes no sense to me.  I can't find meaning without looking for it.  If I find meaning without looking for it, then I'm not looking for it, and it doesn't make sense to say I found it.  I find meaning by looking for it.\n\nComment: But you might not be looking for it intentionally. You might not even be aware that you are looking for meaning. Nevertheless, you are still looking for it.\n\nComment: That's another argument, and it doesn't relate to this question.  It's a question about what the meaning of life is, not how you find meaning.  Finding meaning is irrelevant to the question.\n\nComment: Because the meaning of life is to find meaning.\n\nComment: No, that's not what I said.  I said that finding meaning is irrelevant to the question.  If you want to argue that the meaning of life is to find meaning, that's a different argument.  I'm not going to agree or disagree with that, because it's not the meaning of life.  It's just an argument.\n\nComment: The meaning of life is to find meaning. It is not a different argument.\n\nComment: I don't understand why you're not just accepting that you're wrong, and just accepting that.  No one is going to agree that the meaning of life is to find meaning.  No one", "I think part of the problem is that the question is not well-defined. Even the question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" is not well-defined. There are two answers to that question.\n\nOne answer, the one that most people seem to mean, is that there is some \"meaning\" to the universe. But this answer is not very useful, because it gives you no way to figure out what that \"meaning\" is.\n\nThe other answer is that the meaning of life is in the life that you lead. In other words, the meaning of life is not some objective meaning that the universe has, but it is a subjective meaning that you give to your life. This answer is much more helpful, because it actually tells you how to find meaning in your life.\n\nComment: I wish I could give you more upvotes. This is the best answer so far, and I wish people would understand this one. +1\n\nComment: For me, the meaning of life is to stay alive. I'm not sure what I would do if I found the meaning of life. Maybe I'd lose it or something.\n\nComment: @JeffO, I agree but that's not the question. The question is \"What is the meaning of life?\" The answer is \"The meaning of life is to stay alive\". I.e. it's subjective and not the same answer as the original question.\n\nComment: @Sid I'm asking the question for the sake of the question. I realize that it's not the answer that it's looking for.\n\nComment: @JeffO: I'm just saying that it's not the answer to the question that is being asked. The question asks \"What is the meaning of life\" and the answer is \"The meaning of life is to stay alive\". I'm not saying that it's a bad answer, but it's not the answer to the question being asked.\n\nComment: @Sid I think we're on the same page here.\n\nComment: The question, \"What is the meaning of life?\" is so vague and subjective that no answer could possibly be considered \"the\" answer. The question is meaningless.\n\nComment: @AviBerger: I think the question can be answered. The answer is to be found in a person's life, and the meaning of life is what you find in your life.\n\nComment: @JeffO: I think the question can be answered. The answer is to be found in a person's life, and the meaning of life is what you find in your life.\n\nComment: @Sid: I agree that the question can be answered, but the answer cannot possibly be considered \"the\" answer. There are certainly as many answers as there are people.\n\nComment: @AviBerger: I agree that the question can be answered, but the answer cannot possibly be considered \"the\" answer. There are certainly as many answers as there are people.\n\nComment: You are right. I was wrong.\n\nAnswer: The meaning of life is the happiness you get from the experiences you have.\n\nComment: The meaning of life is to have a meaning of life.\n\nComment: @MarkTrapp: +1 I like that answer! :)\n\nAnswer: This is a very difficult question to answer, and I don't think there's a definitive answer to it. The meaning of life is different to different people.\n\nThere are many ways to find meaning in your life though, and I'll list a few of them:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Do things that make you happy.\n\\item Discover what makes you happy and do it as often as possible.\n\\item Live for your family.\n\\item Live for your friends.\n\\item Live for yourself.\n\\item Live for your country.\n\\item Live for your religion.\n\\item Live for your god.\n\\item Live for humanity.\n\\item Live for your family.\n\\item Live for your god.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nI hope this answer helps you.\n\nComment: I do not know if you are aware of it, but \"live for yourself\" is a very similar to \"live for humanity\".\n\nComment: It's not the same thing.\n\nComment: I am not sure how it is not.\n\nComment: \"Live for humanity\" means that you're doing things for the benefit for all of humanity, whereas \"live for yourself\" means you're doing things for your own benefit.\n\nComment: That's true,", "This is a very complicated question, but I will try to give some ideas.\n\nThe question itself has been approached from a variety of angles and by a variety of people.\n\n\\strong{The Existentialist angle:}\n\nThis angle is best represented by Kierkegaard. According to him, it is not enough to know the meaning of life, we must also know how to live it. He says we cannot live life in an abstract way.\n\nYou can live the meaning of life, but you do not understand the meaning of life.\n\n\\strong{The Religious angle:}\n\nThis angle is represented by Christianity, and arguably by all other religions as well. According to it, the meaning of life is found in God. The meaning of life is to seek God, to know him and to find salvation in him.\n\n\\strong{The Philosophical angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be applied universally. They are looking for a meaning that is objective and can apply to anyone, regardless of their beliefs or philosophical background.\n\n\\strong{The psychological angle:}\n\nThis is perhaps the most common approach. People who approach the meaning of life from this angle are simply looking for a meaning that will help them cope with the problems of everyday life. They are looking for a feeling of purpose and fulfillment, and they are often willing to accept any answer that seems to fit the bill.\n\n\\strong{The Nihilistic angle:}\n\nThis angle is represented by Nietzsche. According to him, the meaning of life is the will to power. The meaning of life is to seek power and to use it to dominate others.\n\n\\strong{The Atheist angle:}\n\nAtheists do not believe in God, so the meaning of life is not to be found in God. Instead, atheists believe that the meaning of life is to be found in human experience. They believe that the meaning of life can be found in the things that make life worth living, such as love, friendship, and family.\n\n\\strong{The Materialist angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be found in material things. They are looking for a meaning that can be found in the things that we can see, touch, and feel.\n\n\\strong{The Evolutionary angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be found in evolution. They believe that the meaning of life is to evolve and to leave the world a better place than it was when we came into it.\n\n\\strong{The Egoistic angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be found in the individual. They believe that the meaning of life is to find a way to live that is fulfilling and meaningful to you.\n\n\\strong{The Political angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be found in politics. They believe that the meaning of life is to create a world that is fair and just.\n\n\\strong{The Spiritual angle:}\n\nThose who approach the meaning of life from this angle are looking for a meaning that can be found in the spirit. They believe that the meaning of life is to find a way to connect with the spirit and to live a life that is in harmony with it.\n\nSo, as you can see, there are many different angles that can be taken when asking the question of the meaning of life. Each angle has its own answer, and each answer has its own meaning. Which angle is right is a matter of opinion.\n\nAnswer: The meaning of life is to be happy, to find joy in everything you do.\n\n\"The meaning of life is defined not by the meaning of life but by what we live for\"-C.S Lewis\n\nThe meaning of life is not something that we can find out, we can just live it.\n\nThe meaning of life is not something that we can find out, we can just live it.\n\nComment: Is this answer actually based on your own personal philosophy, or is it based on the philosophy of someone else?\n\nComment: I believe that the meaning of life is to be happy, to find joy in everything you do. I do not believe that the meaning of life can be found in anything else.\n\nComment: [This](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&tab=mw&ei=4", "\\section{Different people want different things}\n\nWhat people are asking when they ask \"what is the meaning of life?\" depends on who is asking.

{"prompt": "Could an organism on Earth perceive time in both directions?", "response_list": ["I think the answer is yes, but not as we normally think of things.\n\nThe simplest example is a [Bucket Brigage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_brigade) (BCD). If you have two buckets (A and B) and a rope that can be lifted up and down, you can have the bucket B on a higher level than bucket A.\n\nIf you then fill bucket A with sand and have the sand flow into bucket B, you can see the sand level rising in bucket B. If you have a clock in bucket A, you could time the rising of the sand.\n\nIf you now lift the rope up and you can see the sand level falling, you can time the dropping of the sand.\n\nSo an organism could perceive the time both ways like that.\n\nComment: I like this answer. I wouldn't call it \"perceiving time\" in the sense of \"experiencing the passage of time\", but it does describe a way to \"mark time\".\n\nComment: @NuclearWang: I think the OP is asking about something like this, he just doesn't know how to ask for it.\n\nComment: That would be a very good answer if it wasn't for the fact that it is not actually perceiving time. It is simply doing a series of measurements.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: I don't see the difference. How does one perceive time? I would say by measuring it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I think that is the question that needs to be answered. How does one perceive time? Because I thought that is what the OP was asking.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: The answer is quite clear: By measuring it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I'm not sure that I agree with that. I think perception of time is very separate from measuring it.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: It is not separate. It is the same.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: In the sense that to perceive a measurement is to measure it. I disagree with that.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: I don't understand what you mean by that.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I mean that perceiving time is distinct from measuring it.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: It is not. In order to perceive something, you have to measure it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I disagree. I think the way we perceive time is not necessarily the same as how we measure it.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: But you do measure time when you perceive it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I don't think you understand what I'm trying to say.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: Please explain it. I'm sure you can do it in a few words.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I think it is obvious, but I'll try to explain. If you perceive time, you are not necessarily measuring it.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: That is obviously true. But it is also true that you can't perceive time unless you measure it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I disagree. I'm sure that you can perceive time without measuring it.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: Sure you can. But then you cannot perceive it accurately.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I think we're just disagreeing on what it means to perceive time.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: I think we are.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: I'm interested in hearing your view on the matter as well. It's not that I think you're wrong, but I do have a different opinion.\n\nComment: @Ghedeon: I think it is obvious. When you perceive something you measure it.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: And I think it's obvious that you don't necessarily measure it when you perceive something.\n\nComment: @JoeBlow: That's a very good point, but I think there are two issues. First, I think the word \"perceive\" is very vague, and I might just be misinterpreting your definition. Second, I think that in the OP's question, a more appropriate word than \"perceive\" is \"ex", "I'm not sure what you mean by \"perceive time in both directions.\"\n\nFor an organism on Earth, time goes in one direction. We can't perceive time going in the other direction.\n\nTime is just a human construct. It's not a real thing.\n\nComment: I mean that time would go in both directions.\n\nComment: @user118006 Your question is still not clear.  Suppose an organism could perceive time in both directions. What would be different? It would perceive more of it?\n\nComment: The organism would perceive more of it.\n\nComment: @user118006 You haven't explained what that means.\n\nComment: @user118006 It seems you're talking about the *future* and the *past*.  What are you asking?\n\nComment: I'm asking if an organism could perceive both the future and the past.\n\nComment: @user118006 Why would an organism perceive the past?\n\nComment: Because it would perceive events in the future, and then after those events occur, it would perceive them in the past.\n\nComment: @user118006 It's *now* that the events have occurred.  If the organism perceives future events, then the future events have already occurred.  If the organism perceives past events, then the past events have already occurred.  As you say, the organism perceives both future and past events.  I don't understand what you're asking.\n\nComment: @user118006 I don't understand what you've just said.  You're saying that the organism would perceive both future and past events.  I agree.  But you're also saying that the organism would perceive future events before they occur.  I don't understand what you're asking.

I don't know what you're asking.\n\nComment: @user118006 I don't understand what you're asking.  If the organism perceives future events, then the events have already occurred.  If the organism perceives past events, then the events have already occurred.  If the organism perceives future and past events, then the future and past events have already occurred.  What are you asking?\n\nComment: @user118006 I don't understand your question.  If you perceive future events, then the future events have already occurred.  If you perceive past events, then the past events have already occurred.  What is your question?\n\nAnswer: A biological organism is a machine that processes sensory information.\n\nThe \"mind\" is the collection of information that has been processed through the sensory system.\n\nThe \"time\" that you are referring to is the time that is stored in the mind.\n\nThe \"time\" that is stored in the mind is time that has already passed.\n\nThus, organisms on Earth perceive time in one direction.\n\nComment: I'm asking if an organism could perceive time in both directions.\n\nComment: @user118006 That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying that only time that has already passed is stored in the mind.  An organism can't \"perceive\" time in both directions.  If you perceive the past, then the past has already occurred.  If you perceive the future, then the future has already occurred.  Thus, you can only perceive time in one direction--the direction that time is actually going.\n\nComment: No, that's not what I'm saying. An organism could perceive both time in the future and time in the past.\n\nComment: @user118006 How can an organism perceive future time?  It can only perceive past time.  You can't perceive time in both directions.  You can only perceive time in the direction that time is actually going.\n\nComment: I think you're wrong. Time is just a human construct.\n\nComment: @user118006 You're just wrong.  I'm not wrong.", "[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Podolsky%E2%80%93Rosen_paradox#The_EPR_paradox).  If one considers the [EPR paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Podolsky%E2%80%93Rosen_paradox), two particles that are entangled can be separated by great distance.  They cannot be affected by each other's states, but they are definitely entangled, so one cannot be in a state without the other being in the corresponding state.  This is a paradox because it suggests that information is being shared between the particles, something that the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem) implies cannot be done in the absence of a connection.  The best explanation for the phenomenon is that a measurement on one of the particles causes the other to instantaneously assume its corresponding state.\n\nThe [EPR paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Podolsky%E2%80%93Rosen_paradox) has also been interpreted as saying that a measurement on one of the particles causes the other to be in that state, but that the measurement does not cause the particle to be in that state.  In other words, they are already in those states, but their states are only revealed by a measurement.  The effect is that they are in a superposition of states, but the state is not revealed until a measurement is performed.\n\nThis also suggests that both particles are in a superposition of states.  Since they are entangled, they are both in the same superposition of states, meaning that the particle on earth is simultaneously in a superposition of states.  This implies that it is capable of perceiving time in both directions.\n\nComment: This does not answer the question. The question was \"Could an organism on Earth perceive time in both directions?\" The answer is no. The entanglement of a pair of particles does not allow a single particle to perceive time in both directions.", "It's fairly well accepted that time is an emergent property of the universe - it's a construct. Time is a measurement of change. All of the change that has ever happened is part of the past. All of the change that has yet to happen is part of the future.\n\nThe past is what has happened. The future is what \\em{might} happen.\n\nMight being the operative word. We can calculate it fairly accurately, but there are always variables that are not known.\n\nSo, I would say that it's not possible for an organism to perceive time in both directions. They would only be able to observe it in one direction - the past, because the future is not fixed.\n\nAnswer: In theory, the answer is no.  You cannot perceive the future.  If you somehow could, then you would know what you are going to do before you do it.  You would know the results of your actions before you do them.  You would know exactly what the future holds.\n\nIn practice, of course, our perception of the future is limited by the fact that we do not know everything.  We cannot predict with 100% accuracy what exactly the future holds.  We cannot predict what will happen in the next second, let alone in the next week, month, or year.  So our perception of the future is limited by our imperfect knowledge of the universe.\n\nComment: The question asked for a perceptual ability, not a predictive one.\n\nComment: @JeffE: The OP's question is unclear.  \"Perception\" implies awareness of something, and by definition the future has not happened yet and therefore cannot be perceived in the sense of the question.  \"Prediction\" is the only other possibility.  If I am wrong, then I am wrong.  If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.\n\nComment: I agree with you. The question is unclear, or it may be that there is no such thing. I would have to know more about the nature of the organism to determine whether or not it is even possible.\n\nComment: @JeffE: If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.  If I am wrong, then I am wrong.  Whether or not there is a \"such a thing\" is irrelevant.  The definition of \"perception\" is awareness.  The future, by definition, has not happened yet.  Therefore, it cannot be perceived in the sense that the OP is using the word.  If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.  In the sense that the OP is using the word, there is no such thing as perceiving the future.\n\nComment: I think that a simple experiment would be to place an organism in a sealed environment and observe it.  After a few days, we could ask the organism, \"What will happen next?\"  If it knows what will happen next, then it is perceiving the future.\n\nComment: @JeffE: I don't think so.  If the organism knows what will happen next, then it already knows what will happen next.  There is no future prediction involved.  So the organism either knows what will happen next because it has already happened, or it knows what will happen next because it already knows what will happen next.  In either case, the organism knows what will happen next because it has already happened.  If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.\n\nComment: @JeffE: I agree with you that the question is unclear.  It is unclear whether or not the OP is asking about awareness or prediction.  It is unclear if the OP is talking about prediction of the future or prediction of the past.  If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.  I just don't agree with you that there is no such thing as perceiving the future.  I just don't agree with you that it is possible for the organism to perceive the future.  If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.\n\nComment: The question is also unclear as to whether the organism in question is itself capable of perception in the first place. I can't tell from the question whether the OP is dealing with a human-like being or an animal or something else entirely.\n\nComment: @JeffE: If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.

If the OP is unclear, then the OP is unclear.", "\\strong{Yes.}\n\nThe \"inverse of time\" is called \"time reversal symmetry\". It's a symmetry that is violated in our universe (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_reversal_symmetry). This means that a time-reversed universe would be different from ours.\n\nThere are some other answers that suggest the \"arrow of time\" is due to time-reversible equations. This is not the case. Time-reversible equations can be used to model a universe that has time reversal symmetry. The \"arrow of time\" is due to time-reversal symmetry being violated.\n\nA time-reversal invariant universe would be one where the laws of physics are exactly the same, except with $t\\to -t$, and in which there is no other time-reversal symmetry violating phenomena (like entropy).\n\nComment: But I'm asking for the perception of time. I'm not asking for whether a universe with time reversal symmetry could exist or not.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava I read your question as asking for how a time-reversed universe would differ from ours. I think I answered your question.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava Yes, I'm saying that the laws of physics would be the same, except with $t\\to -t$.\n\nComment: The laws of physics are the same, but the physical reality is not. This is because time in a sense is defined by entropy. This is why when I move my hand from left to right, it is perceived as the past becoming the present and not the future becoming the past.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava That is incorrect. Entropy is a conserved quantity in a time-reversal invariant universe. It only \"points to the future\" in our universe because of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. I have not studied any physics for years now.

I'm sorry if I'm asking stupid questions.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava No problem.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava I was merely trying to explain why the laws of physics are the same in a time-reversal invariant universe.\n\nComment: You were right. I was wrong. Thank you.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava Thanks. I've also added a bit more detail to my answer. Let me know if you have any questions.\n\nAnswer: This answer refers to the question, \"could an organism on Earth perceive time in both directions?\".\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia, Time reversal symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_reversal_symmetry), it is possible for an organism to perceive time in both directions.\n\nIn my opinion, this is because the laws of physics are reversible, but the universe is not. When we observe time, we are observing the universe. Since the universe is not time-reversible, there is an arrow of time.\n\nThis means that the universe can be described mathematically as a time-reversible function, but not time-reversible in its physical reality. This is because the entropy of the universe is not increasing.\n\nThe entropy of universe could be increasing if the laws of physics were not reversible.\n\nComment: No, the universe is time-reversible, because the laws of physics are reversible.\n\nComment: @PM2Ring I know that the laws of physics are reversible, but the universe is not. The universe is not reversible because entropy is not increasing.\n\nComment: What do you mean \"the universe is not reversible because entropy is not increasing\"?\n\nComment: @PM2Ring I mean that entropy is not increasing, so that means the universe is not reversible. My argument is that the laws of physics are reversible, but the universe is not.\n\nComment: I don't understand why the arrow of time is due to entropy. I thought the arrow of time was due to the laws of physics being time-reversible, and not time-reversible in the physical reality.\n\nComment: @RishabhBhargava No, it's due to the laws of physics being time-reversible.

Analyze the pain}\n\nFirst, you need to figure out what the current pain is.  In my case, I found that most developers had a good idea of how documentation should be done, but were either too lazy or felt that their task was more important than documentation.  After a while, the documentation was either out of date, or simply never existed.\n\n\\section{2. Identify the stakeholders}\n\nNext, you need to find out who the stakeholders are.  In my case, the stakeholders were the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Developers\n\\item Product Managers\n\\item Product Owners\n\\item Sales\n\\item Executives\n\\item Support\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{3. Identify the metrics}\n\nSo now you need to figure out what would be the best metrics to use to measure your progress.  In my case, I used the following:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of bugs reported by developers\n\\item Number of bugs reported by support staff\n\\item Average time to reproduce bugs\n\\item Customer Satisfaction Score\n\\item Customer Churn Rate\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{4. Analyze the metrics}\n\nOnce you have the metrics, you need to analyze them.  In my case, I found that the following metrics were the most important:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of bugs reported by developers\n\\item Number of bugs reported by support staff\n\\item Average time to reproduce bugs\n\\item Customer Satisfaction Score\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{5. Meet with the stakeholders}\n\nNow that you have the metrics, you need to meet with the stakeholders and explain what you found.  In my case, I met with the following people:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Developers\n\\item Product Managers\n\\item Product Owners\n\\item Sales\n\\item Executives\n\\item Support\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{6. Get buy-in}\n\nNow that you have the buy-in, it's time to implement your plan.  In my case, I implemented the following changes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Every developer was required to write at least one article per week\n\\item Every developer was required to write at least one article per month\n\\item Every developer was required to update their article at least once per month\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{7. Measure the results}\n\nNow that you have implemented your plan, it's time to measure the results.  In my case, I measured the following results:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Number of bugs reported by developers\n\\item Number of bugs reported by support staff\n\\item Average time to reproduce bugs\n\\item Customer Satisfaction Score\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{8. Iterate}\n\nNow that you have measured the results, it's time to iterate.

Eating a well-prepared, carefully balanced dish in small portions can be a much more satisfying experience than eating a larger portion of a lesser dish.\n\nComment: That's a very good point. I would add that the quality of the food is more crucial in a higher end restaurant.\n\nAnswer: My guess is that it's a combination of the other answers.  The portions are smaller because the restaurant wants to serve you more food, and they're \\em{really} good at cooking it.\n\nMy wife and I ate at a small 2 star Michelin rated restaurant in France last year, and we were brought a small plate of food as a complimentary appetizer.  We were also presented a plate of cheese with our dessert.\n\nThis is a common practice in France.

So when I was browsing the \"recently active\" questions, I saw the comment, but not the answer.  A comment was posted, but no answer, so I posted an answer.  I think the \"recently active\" list is sorted by time posted, not by time answered.\n\nAnswer: I think restaurants in general want to get you in and out as quickly as possible. If you're served a small portion but you're very full, you're less likely to order dessert or drinks, both of which are very profitable for the restaurant.\n\nI've never been to a high-class restaurant, but I imagine this would be particularly true for them.\n\nComment: That's a good point, but not the whole story.  High-end restaurants *want* you to order dessert and drinks.  The portions are small because they're trying to showcase their food, and they want a reasonable amount to fit on a serving plate.\n\nAnswer: It's a combination of all of the above.  The smaller portion, and the better quality of food, go together to create a more enjoyable experience.  The smaller portion allows you to enjoy the food more slowly, and to savor it.  It also allows you to taste all of the different flavors in the food, rather than just the main flavor of the meat.  I'm a fan of small portions.  It's a shame that our cultural view of food has changed since the 1950s, and that we now expect huge portions of food and huge amounts of meat with every meal.\n\nComment: A small portion of food and huge amount of meat are not the same thing.

I'm just saying that I don't think it's the primary reason that high-end restaurants serve small portions.\n\nComment: I'm saying that it's a partial reason.  The primary reason is that they want to maximize the profits of the experience.  The only way to do that is to keep the portions small.  If I were spending $75 for a steak dinner, I wouldn't want to fill up on a huge plate of food.  That would kill my appetite for the main dish.  I'd rather have a small portion that makes me hungry for the main dish.\n\nComment: @Konrad:  I'd rather have them serve me a large plate with a great main dish.  I don't want to pay $75 for a $3 steak and a $3 side dish.  I'm not saying that they don't want to maximize the profits.  I'm saying that if they wanted to maximize the profits, they would serve a single $25 steak and a $25 side dish, instead of $10 steaks and $10 side dishes.  That's the *only* reason I can think of that they would serve such small portions.\n\nComment: @Konrad:  The most generous pours of wine I've ever had at a high-end restaurant were in Italy.\n\nComment: @Konrad: I'll have to agree on Italy, but the last time I visited Italy, I was a teenager, and we were on a budget.  I'm not sure if things have changed since then.  I'll have to visit again someday.\n\nComment: @Konrad:  I've had some fantastic meals in Italy, but I've never had a meal in Italy where I thought I was getting shortchanged.\n\nAnswer: My guess is that the food is cooked to order, and the restaurant doesn't want to lose money by throwing away food that they didn't cook.\n\nComment: I would think that a restaurant that charges $25 for a small plate of food would be able to afford to throw away the occasional plate of food.\n\nComment: @Konrad:  You'd think so, but there's an old saying:  \"I've never seen a waiter get rich.\"\n\nComment: @Konrad: I think it's more of a matter of \"I've never seen a waiter get rich by wasting food\".  Food costs are a large part of the cost of running a restaurant.\n\nComment: @Konrad:  It's not only that waiters don't get rich, but that even the most successful restaurants don't get rich.

I commented on this to the waiter, who explained that the salad was made of a very expensive ingredient.\n\nAnswer: It could be that the ingredients are very expensive and the kitchen prepares them into very small portions.

I suppose the HR director could do that, and then if the employees wanted to contribute, he could say \"well, if you'd all like to contribute, that's fine, but I'll handle it myself and make it a surprise\".\n\nComment: @LorenPechtel That is what I would do in the situation.", "\\strong{It's a bad idea.}\n\nI have personally received a gift from my employees. It was a gift certificate to a local restaurant. I appreciated it, and I believe it enhanced the work environment. But it was given as part of a group gift from multiple employees.\n\nThe fact that \\em{I} accepted it does not mean that \\em{other} employees would. I can imagine that there would be some employees who would be offended by receiving a gift from their colleagues, in particular if there were a power differential (e.g. manager) among the givers and receivers. And some employees might even be offended by the idea of their manager receiving gifts from their colleagues.\n\nThe problem with gifts is that they can be viewed as bribes, and if a manager is accepting gifts from employees, they can be viewed as bribing their manager.\n\nIf you are not sure that everyone will appreciate it, or if you need to create a perception that you are not being bribed, it is best to avoid it.", "I've worked in organizations that did this, and I always thought it was a bad practice.  It seems like a good way to make people feel like they're being asked to contribute to a boss's present, and not to a gift for someone who's not in their reporting chain.\n\nIt also seems like a recipe for resentment, since some people might be expected to contribute more than others.\n\nComment: It also seems like a bad way to treat upper management, as if they are no better than the rest of the employees.\n\nComment: +1 for the resentment: even if the upper level employee doesn't know about the contributions, it's only one step away from having the contributions presented to them by the office manager with a smile.\n\nComment: I'd say it's a bad practice to ask employees for money.  Especially if it's a present for a manager.  That's a terrible idea, and should never be done, if you *really* want to keep a good relationship with your employees.\n\nAnswer: I've never seen that done in my own work experience (nor have I heard of it), but if I were asked to contribute to such a gift, I'd probably say no.  Particularly if the gift was for a manager (boss) and not a member of the team.\n\nComment: \"Particularly if the gift was for a manager (boss) and not a member of the team.\" I don't think this should be a factor.  The boss deserves respect and the team deserves respect.\n\nComment: +1 for a manager. I wouldn't give a present to my manager. I don't want to put my boss in a awkward position if he feels he should reciprocate.\n\nComment: I'm going to disagree here.  Giving a gift to a manager is a great way to promote team building.  The boss who says \"thank you, but I can't accept this gift, you should have given it to someone else\" is a boss I'd want to work for.\n\nComment: I think it's a matter of what kind of relationship you have with your manager. If you get along, and they're generally a good guy/gal, you could probably get away with giving a gift to them, and they'd be cool about it. If you're not getting along, and you feel your manager is not a good guy/gal, I don't think it's a good idea to give them a gift.\n\nComment: If you are giving a gift to a manager you know personally, that's one thing. If you are giving a gift to a manager you have no personal relationship with, that's something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: I think it's a bad idea.  First, it can make the employees who don't contribute feel like outsiders.  Second, it can make the people who don't have a lot of money feel like they're being taken advantage of.  Third, it can create a bad impression of the upper-manager who is the recipient of the gift.\n\nComment: +1 for the outsider comment.  I've worked in a few places that have done things like this, and the people who didn't contribute felt like they were being left out.\n\nAnswer: It's a terrible idea.  Not only is it likely to cause ill-feelings among those who contribute vs. those who don't, but even for those who do contribute it's likely to create the impression that the gift is not from them, but from the company or from the company's management.\n\nI've never heard of this being done in any company I've worked for, and I've worked in a wide variety of industries and locations.  It's usually the company (or some portion of the company) that gives gifts to upper management, not the staff.\n\nThat said, I think it's not unreasonable for the company to contribute to the gift, and it's not unreasonable for upper management to contribute to the gift.  It's just not reasonable for the company to ask lower level employees to contribute to the gift.\n\nAnswer: The idea is not a bad one but the practice can make some employees feel left out.  It can also make the employees feel that they are being asked to contribute to the boss's present, and that is not a good idea.\n\nI have seen this done in my workplace, and while it is fine to", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat are your thoughts when HR asks employees for money as a gift?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIf this is for a specific person then I think it's fine.

If the person is a valued employee, it is a good gesture to show appreciation.\n\nComment: @MikeBrockington: What if the person is not a valued employee?\n\nComment: I'd rather be asked to contribute to a gift for a specific person than to a group of people. If a person has worked hard and shown to be a valued employee, it's nice to show appreciation.\n\nComment: @MikeBrockington: Sure, but I think you have to ask yourself why you're doing it.  It's not the same as a group of employees agreeing to buy something nice for their boss as a surprise.  In that case, it's a nice gesture.  But if you have to ask everyone for some money to give to the boss, it's because you don't have the money to do it yourself.\n\nComment: I agree with that. If it's a group and people don't want to contribute, then the gift should be scaled back to something that can be contributed by the whole group.\n\nComment: @MikeBrockington: Yes, but in my experience, the \"gift\" is not scaled back, it's just that the boss gets something from everyone, instead of everyone contributing to the purchase of something special.  The result is the same, but it's a much different perception.\n\nAnswer: I would be happy to contribute, but I'd want to know that the donation was voluntary and not a requirement.\n\nComment: I agree with this.

It's usually a group of folks that know the person well, and they collect money and buy a gift.

It's better if the request is coming from co-workers.\n\nComment: I'm not sure what exactly you mean by that, but I'm guessing that's a bad idea?\n\nComment: I was referring to \"upper management\".\n\nComment: Yeah, I'm not a fan of upper management asking for money. If it's coming from co-workers, then it's much better. I don't think upper managment should be asking for money from employees for anything, even if it isn't for a gift.\n\nAnswer: I agree with the other answers that it is not a bad idea. But I think the way the message is worded has a big impact on how people feel about it.\n\nFor example, if the request is coming from upper management, I feel like it would sound very strange to ask people to contribute money to a gift for someone else. And it might be difficult for people to agree to do that.\n\nFor example, what if someone can't afford to contribute to the gift? It might make them feel like they are not contributing enough to the company.\n\nI would also be careful about how the message is worded. For example, if the message says that people will be contributing a gift for someone else, it might make people feel like they are not contributing enough to the company.\n\nI think it would be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nI think it would also be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nIf the message says that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to, it might make people feel like they are not contributing enough to the company.\n\nI think it would be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: I think it would be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: I think it would also be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: If the message says that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to, it might make people feel like they are not contributing enough to the company.\n\nComment: I think it would be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: I think it would also be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: If the message says that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to, it might make people feel like they are not contributing enough to the company.\n\nComment: I think it would be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: I think it would also be best if the message said that people are contributing to a gift for someone else, and that they are doing it because they want to.\n\nComment: If the message says that people are contributing to a"]}
{"prompt": "what are the green flags and red flags of PhD applicants?", "response_list": ["\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIn my opinion, the best way to judge a PhD candidate is by talking to them.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI agree with this.  A PhD candidate should be able to discuss their work in a way that is not only comprehensible to their advisor, but also to other people in the field.  The key is that the candidate is able to take an abstract, complex idea and explain it in a way that has meaning for the listener.  That's no easy task.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI'm not a professor, but I am a PhD candidate in my second year in a top 50 program.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIt's fine if you're not a professor.  There are many other ways to judge a candidate.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nAs a PhD candidate, I have met many candidates from other programs.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nGood.  This is an excellent way to get a feel for what's out there.  But, again, your opinion is not a substitute for your advisor's.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI'm looking for specific indicators (not the obvious ones like GPA) that would distinguish a candidate in my program from the rest of the pack.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI would say that GPA is a very good indicator.  A GPA of 3.8 or higher is often considered to be excellent for a PhD candidate.  A GPA of 3.5 or higher is usually excellent.  This is, of course, just one indicator.  It's also possible for a GPA to be misleading.  For example, an undergraduate who got all A's may not be a good PhD candidate if they were in an easy program.  On the other hand, a candidate who has gotten 3.6's and 3.7's throughout their academic career may be a very good candidate.  That being said, a low GPA (below 3.0) is often a sign of a bad candidate.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious, but I'll say it anyway:  the more you know about the candidate's work, the better.  Are they good writers?  Are they good teachers?  Do they know the literature of their field?  Do they make good presentations?  These are all very good indicators of the quality of a PhD candidate.  Note that I'm talking about knowledge of the literature, not just the ability to parrot back a few memorized facts.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe candidate must have been a good undergraduate (3.8+ GPA, publications, research, awards, etc.)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThere are two problems with this criterion: 1) it is not easily quantifiable and 2) it is subjective.  A good undergraduate may not be a good PhD candidate.  It is also up to your advisor to decide what is and is not a good publication, research, or award.  As someone who has been involved in hiring PhD candidates, I can tell you that I have been disappointed by candidates who thought they were fantastic, only to find out that they weren't.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe candidate must have been a good graduate student (good grades, etc.)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is basically the same problem as the first criteria.  It's not quantifiable.  And it's subjective.  In my experience, good grades are usually a good indicator, but they're not always a perfect indicator.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nThe candidate must have good recommendations (strongly recommend for admission, etc.)\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is a good indicator, but it's not perfect.  There's nothing to stop a student from asking for recommendations from professors who are friends or colleagues.  If the student does this, the recommendations may not be very helpful.\n\nComment: This is a good answer.  I would add that the candidate should also have a clear sense of what they want to do after they finish the Ph.D.  A Ph.D. prepares students for a career in academia, but there are many other options, such as industry, government, or non-profit.  It's a good idea to know what you want to do with your Ph.D., and to have a plan to get there.\n\nComment: I", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhen I apply for a PhD position, how should I mention having a master's degree?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNormally, it isn't necessary.

If it's a survey paper, turning it into a journal article might not be a good idea. If it's a novel experimental result, it might be a good idea.\n\\item If the thesis is a joint project, you'll need to check with the other authors to see if they're willing to publish it.\n\\item You'll have to think about the amount of work it's going to take to turn the thesis into a paper.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nComment: \"If the thesis uses somebody else's data, you'll probably need to get permission from those people.\" This is a very good point.  I've seen people try to get away with that, and it usually comes back to bite them.\n\nComment: @JeffE: I've seen it too. It's not uncommon for people to try to use other people's data without permission.\n\nComment: @JeffE: A related issue: What if the data are too big to publish in a peer-reviewed article?

See, e.g., http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0586.\n\nComment: @PeteL.Clark: That's a very good question. I've always thought that it would be OK to publish a thesis on data that can't be published in a peer-reviewed paper, but I've never had the courage to do it.\n\nComment: @JeffE, if a thesis uses data from someone else, those data must be cited. Is permission needed to cite those data?\n\nComment: @JeffE: That's true, but it's not always enough. If you do a survey, for example, you can cite the data that you use, but it's not always possible to publish a paper based on the survey.\n\nComment: @JeffE: To be precise, I think it's true that you can publish a journal article based on a survey, but it might be a pain.\n\nComment: @JeffE: In my experience, the situation is that you can't get permission to publish all the data you want to publish, so you have to make a judgement call about how much is enough.

A PhD is a lot more work than you can possibly imagine. The reason why it's worth doing is you get to learn a lot and be the best in the world at something.\n\nIf your reason for doing a PhD is that you think it's a good career choice without having any idea of what a PhD entails, you're not going to get very far.\n\nAlso, don't let the fact that you're in a humanities department fool you.

I would say that intelligence and determination are orthogonal.\n\nComment: @David: I think that intelligence is a subset of determination. You may not be able to learn calculus, but you will be determined by trying, and that's why you're not intelligent. The smarter you are, the less determined you need to be.\n\nComment: @Rahul: I don't think that's true.  Perhaps a more accurate way of putting it is that intelligence is a pre-requisite for determination.  If you were intelligent enough to understand calculus, you would be determined enough to try to learn it.  But it's certainly possible to be determined enough to try to learn calculus and not be intelligent enough to do it.\n\nComment: @David: I agree that it is possible to be determined enough to learn calculus without being intelligent enough.

But there are quite a few things that one can guess from the application.\n\nA clear sign of a promising applicant is a good undergraduate degree (in terms of grades and research). If the applicant is applying for a PhD in the same field as their undergraduate studies, they probably already have a good understanding of the research. If it's a new field, then the applicant might have some familiarity with the field from other courses. However, if the applicant is from a different field, then there are a few things that you can infer:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Are they passionate about the field? (They could be passionate, but there's no way to know that from the application.)\n\\item Do they have some knowledge or experience in the field? (This is very important. If they don't, they might not be able to get started early on in the program, as they might not be familiar with the basics. Or they might not be able to contribute much to the department.)\n\\item Do they have a good grasp of the mathematics that's required in the field? (This is very important. A good math background will help with understanding the literature, but also with learning and developing new mathematics.)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nAnother good sign is a good recommendation letter from someone familiar with the applicant's work. However, it's not uncommon for students to get good grades in their classes and research projects, but still not be very good at research.\n\nSome other things that might be good signs are: being a good mathematician (as opposed to someone who just knows a lot of mathematics), having a strong desire to pursue a PhD, having good communication skills, having good English skills, having a strong work ethic, having good study habits, having an ability to work independently, etc.\n\nSome other red flags can be that the applicant has a very weak background in undergraduate mathematics (especially if they want to pursue a PhD in mathematics). If someone has a weak background in mathematics, they will have to spend a lot of time learning the basics and won't be able to start research early on in the program.\n\nAnother red flag is if the applicant doesn't have a strong research background in the field in which they are applying for a PhD. If someone doesn't have a strong research background in the field, they will have a hard time getting started early on in the program. It might even be difficult for them to be able to contribute much to the department in the first few years of the program.\n\nAnother red flag is if the applicant doesn't have any research experience. This is a problem because the applicant won't be able to get started early on in the program, as they won't be familiar with the basics of research.\n\nAnother red flag is if the applicant doesn't have good work habits.

Generally, the Federal laws would apply if the rental property is in a building with four or more units.  If the rental is in a building with less than four units, then the Federal laws may not apply, but State laws may.\n\nThe most important law in this case is the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA).  The FHAA amends the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  Under the FHAA, it is illegal to discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of a rental agreement on the basis of a person's disability.  This applies to anyone who owns or operates a rental property.\n\nThe FHAA also requires that you make reasonable modifications of your property, at your expense, to allow a person with a disability to use the property.  This would include installing ramps or railings, widening doorways, installing grab bars in bathrooms, etc.\n\nIn addition to the FHAA, many States have their own laws that prohibit discrimination against the disabled and require that reasonable modifications be made to a property to allow the disabled to use the property.\n\nSo, it sounds like you need to hire a lawyer to protect your sister's rights.

I believe the question has to do with her unit, not the entire building.  If she is in a building with rent stabilization, then her rent can be raised only if she vacates the apartment (or if the building is deregulated).  If she is in a building which is not rent stabilized, then her rent can be raised at any time.  If I'm wrong, someone else can correct me.\n\nAnswer: Whether the rent can be raised or not depends on the type of housing and what the lease says. If she is in a rent controlled apartment, the landlord has to follow the guidelines of rent control. If she is in a rent stabilized apartment, the landlord cannot raise the rent. If she is in a market rate apartment, the landlord can raise the rent at any time.\n\nComment: This is incorrect.  The landlord is only allowed to raise the rent once the tenant has vacated the apartment.  If the tenant is in a rent stabilized apartment, the only way the landlord can raise the rent is if the building is deregulated.", "The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public accommodations and commercial buildings be accessible to those who are disabled.  That includes wheelchair ramps and other accessibility features.  Landlords must allow handicapped tenants to alter their rental units to make them handicapped-accessible.  However, those alterations may not be permanent (i.e. the tenant must be able to move the alterations when they move).\n\nThe landlord may charge a reasonable deposit to cover the cost of restoring the rental unit to its original condition.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act, on the other hand, prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in housing, including discrimination based on a person\u2019s need for a reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act does not require landlords to make their rental properties handicapped-accessible.  However, if a person with a disability needs an accommodation to make the rental property accessible, the landlord must work with the tenant to make the property accessible.  The landlord may not charge the tenant for the alterations in order to make the property handicapped-accessible.  However, the landlord may charge a reasonable deposit to cover the cost of restoring the rental unit to its original condition.\n\nIf the landlord does not allow for the tenant to make the necessary handicapped-accessible alterations to the property, the tenant may file a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The HUD will investigate the complaint.  If it finds that the landlord has discriminated against the tenant, the HUD will order the landlord to stop discriminating against the tenant and will require the landlord to pay the tenant damages and compensation for his or her injury, including the cost of the alterations to the rental property.\n\nSo, your sister may be able to file a complaint with the HUD to get her landlord to allow her to make the necessary handicapped-accessible alterations to the rental property.\n\nComment: \"The Fair Housing Act does not require landlords to make their rental properties handicapped-accessible.\"  In fact, it does.  28 CFR 36.401(b)(1) requires all multifamily housing to be accessible, and 28 CFR 36.401(c)(1) defines \"readily achievable\" as \"without much difficulty or expense\".

A 1997 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that the decline in marriage and increases in illegitimacy did not begin until after the major expansion of the welfare system in the 1960s. In fact, the percentage of births to unmarried women was lower in 1955 than in 1995, when the welfare system had been expanded for more than three decades (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1997).\n\nWhile the welfare system did not cause the decline in marriage and the rise in illegitimacy, it does play a role in perpetuating those trends.

The EITC, the most well-known family policy, also significantly reduces poverty.\"\n\nComment: @DJohnM: Your citation is to a book by Robert Moffitt, an economist who has argued that welfare reduces poverty, and who has written that \"the welfare system has successfully served as a substitute for the male breadwinner and the traditional family.\"\n\nComment: It's easy to find other economists who strongly disagree. I'm not saying that welfare is a magic bullet, but it's not an unambiguously bad thing either.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: It would be great to see a citation to one of the many economists who disagree with Moffitt. Most of the research I've seen on welfare shows that it reduces poverty. I don't think that the EITC is a magic bullet, but it is an extremely important policy in reducing poverty, especially among single mothers.\n\nComment: The EITC is a very big deal. I'm not sure what you're getting at with respect to Moffitt.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: Moffitt's work is often cited by conservatives as proof that welfare does not lead to dependency. He does not agree with that notion.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: The Moffitt quote you cite supports the notion that welfare encourages single motherhood. If you read the book, you will find that Moffitt argues that welfare does not increase dependency, because the jobs that women would otherwise have would be so bad that it would be better for them to be on welfare.\n\nComment: He didn't \"argue that welfare does not increase dependency.\" He argued that \"the welfare system has successfully served as a substitute for the male breadwinner and the traditional family.\" I don't think that's the same thing.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: I don't think that the sentence you cite is a straightforward statement that welfare reduces the need for males, but I agree with you that it does not imply that welfare increases dependency.\n\nComment: I'm not sure why you're being so defensive. I'm just asking for a citation to someone who disagrees with Moffitt.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: I am not being defensive. I am just pointing out that you have not cited any research on this question. If you have a good source that shows that welfare discourages marriage, that would be a good addition to the question.\n\nComment: This is already an excellent answer, but I'm wondering if you could cite some of the studies you mention? I'd be interested in reading them myself.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: The research I've cited is from an article by Moffitt. The article is not available online, but it can be found in The Handbook of Labor Economics, volume 4, page 1341.\n\nComment: I don't think it's a great idea to cite Moffitt as evidence that welfare reduces poverty.\n\nComment: @DJohnM: Moffitt is a leading economist on public policy, and a major source of research on welfare. If you have a good source that shows that welfare reduces poverty, I would be happy to add it to my answer.", "The following statement is not an answer to the question, but is my personal opinion, based on my experience and thoughts about society.\n\nI strongly believe that there is a correlation between welfare programs and illegitimacy.

So it is very difficult to be certain about how much evidence of our civilization will be left.\n\nHowever, there is a good chance that we will leave some evidence.

We've found human remains in caves.\n\nThere's good evidence that we were here 50,000 years ago: 14,000 years ago, 8000 years ago, etc.  The evidence is in the form of remains of our ancestors and other hominids, tools, and cultural objects.  So far as I know, we haven't found evidence of us being here before 50,000 years ago.\n\nIf a catastrophe wipes us out, it will do a pretty good job of wiping out our evidence that we were here; we're good at making things that decay.  And since we're good at making things, we're also good at making things that don't decay.\n\nBut let's say that a catastrophe wipes out everything that we have made.  Then the question is:  what traces would remain for future generations to find?\n\n\\strong{What can last for 50,000 years?}\n\nThere are some things that can last almost forever.  For instance, a diamond can last forever.  Diamonds can be made from materials that are here on Earth.  But it's hard to make a diamond.  It takes a lot of energy.  There's lots of energy here on Earth, but a diamond made from Earth materials would be pretty small.  So it's not clear that the diamond would survive the catastrophe.\n\nEven if the diamond did survive, it's not obvious that a diamond is something that you would expect a future civilization to find.  A future civilization would expect to find either\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item diamonds made by humans, or\n\\item diamonds made by natural processes.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nIf the diamond was made by humans, then it wouldn't be too surprising that it has the same chemical properties as natural diamonds.  If the diamond was made by natural processes, then it would be pretty surprising if it had the same chemical properties as natural diamonds.\n\nIf a diamond is made by humans, then it's possible that the diamond could show a pattern that humans are familiar with seeing.  For instance, a diamond could be cut into the shape of a square or a circle or a triangle.  A future civilization might be able to figure out that the diamond was cut intentionally, and that it's a symbol.\n\nBut I don't know of any diamonds that humans have made that are cut into the shape of a square or a circle or a triangle.  And it would be pretty hard to cut a diamond into the shape of a square or a circle or a triangle.\n\nSo it seems unlikely that a diamond cut into the shape of a square or a circle or a triangle would be something that a future civilization would find.\n\nIf the diamond is a natural diamond, then there's no way for a future civilization to know that it was cut into the shape of a square or a circle or a triangle.\n\n\\strong{What can last for hundreds of thousands of years?}\n\nThere are things that have lasted for hundreds of thousands of years.  One example is the [Cape Mendocino Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Mendocino_Knot).  The Cape Mendocino Knot is a knot that's tied in a rope.  The rope is made from plants.  The knot is still in the rope.  The rope is at least 50,000 years old, and maybe even 200,000 years old.\n\nIf you're asking about a future civilization finding something that was made by humans, then the knot is not a good answer, because it's obviously not something that was made by humans.  (The rope is obviously made by plants.)\n\nIf you're asking about a future civilization finding something that was made by natural processes, then the knot is a good answer, because it's obviously made by natural processes.\n\nBut the knot is not something that can last for millions of years.

This is a pretty long time, and it makes sense that they would have to be maintained and repaired during that time. However, if a nuclear power plant were to be abandoned, it would still be generating electricity for at least a few years after that.\n\nThe reason for this is that nuclear power plants generate electricity by splitting atoms. This releases energy, and that energy is used to create the electricity. Once the atoms have been split, they cannot be put back together again. This means that the energy is lost, and the only way to continue generating electricity is to keep splitting atoms.\n\nSo, if a nuclear power plant was abandoned, it would continue to generate electricity for as long as the atoms were being split. This is a pretty long time, and it means that there would still be evidence of our civilization if a nuclear power plant were to be abandoned.\n\n\\section{Dams}\n\nDams are another example of an infrastructure that would still be generating electricity long after civilization has collapsed. Dams are used to store water, and they are used to generate electricity in a similar way to nuclear power plants. They are designed to operate for a long time, and they must be inspected and maintained regularly.\n\nIf a dam were to be abandoned, it would still be generating electricity for as long as the water was being stored.

It studies the objects and architecture people made and used, and the location and arrangement of those remains. Archaeologists can learn a lot of interesting things from historical and oral documentation, but they use the material remains to fill in the gaps in the written story.\n\n\\em{Prehistoric} archaeology is the study of preliterate societies. It's not that prehistoric civilizations didn't have writing systems, it's just that they didn't write down much, at least for the purposes of historical documentation.\n\nIn any case, the answer to your question is that there will be plenty of evidence of our civilization in 50,000 years.\n\nMost of the materials in modern architecture are stable enough to survive for a long, long time. If you look at prehistoric architecture, you can find examples of stone buildings that survive from ancient civilizations like the Egyptians, the Incas, and the Romans.\n\nIn the case of civilizations like the Romans, we know that their writing systems were lost to history until their remains were discovered by archaeologists.\n\nThere are even examples of modern materials surviving to the present day, like the Pantheon in Rome, which was built in AD 125.\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sRVqs.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nNow, if you think about the average life expectancy of a modern building, you might think that there won't be too many examples of buildings that have survived the test of time. After all, the average life expectancy of a car is about 10 years. A house is about 20 years. A skyscraper might last 40 years before being torn down.\n\nBut the materials used in buildings are far more durable than the materials used in cars. We can find ancient buildings made from stone or brick. Even if we don't have the materials to make those things anymore, the buildings will be around for a long time.\n\nThe same is true of the materials used in modern buildings. The materials used in modern buildings are designed to last for hundreds of years.\n\nIf we were to lose our ability to build things in the future, it would take thousands of years for the materials in our buildings to erode.\n\nSo, even if we lost our ability to build things in the future, there would still be evidence of our civilization in the form of buildings.\n\nComment: If we lose the ability to build things, will we lose the ability to write?

If not, then our descendants would be able to read about our civilization by studying our writing.\n\nAnswer: The answer is definitely yes.\n\nWe are living in an age where we have developed a great many things that last a very long time. Even the most common things such as cars, houses, and even clothes will last for years if cared for properly.\n\nSo, we can definitely say that there will be evidence, even if we lose the ability to produce things.\n\nThat being said, the evidence will likely be limited to things like buildings and roads. If we lose the ability to produce things, we will also lose the ability to produce written records. So, our descendants will not be able to read about our civilization by studying our writing.\n\nAnswer: Yes, there will definitely be evidence.

{"prompt": "I live in the Midwest of U.S., where we love using salt to de-ice our roads. This causes quite a bit of rusting on the underside of cars.

The anode will eventually be consumed.\n\nA better way is to add a corrosion inhibitor to the salt.\n\nComment: This is a good answer, but it may help to expand a bit on why adding an anode won't help. For example, anodes typically corrode at a much faster rate than the rest of the metal object, and by the time the anode is consumed, it's already too late, as the rest of the metal object has already corroded.", "I believe the answer is yes, but only to a limited extent.\n\nThe reason is that the anode isn't the only thing that gets eaten away.  The salt is also oxidizing the steel, and this is why the salt sticks to the car, and the salt crystals are shiny.  So the anode will get eaten away, but the steel will also oxidize.  The best way to prevent rust is to rinse off the salt when you get home.\n\nComment: The salt crystals are not shiny, but rather they are coated with a thin film of oxide. The anode is still the best way to protect the car at the place where it rests on the ground, because the oxide film cannot be rinsed off of the anode. If you are very careful, you will see the oxide film on the anode change color as it is eroded away. In contrast, the salt crystals do not change color as they are consumed.\n\nComment: So does this mean that in the long run the anode is likely going to be replaced with a new one?\n\nComment: @Rahul Yes, it will be replaced, but it usually takes many years to get there.\n\nComment: @JonCuster  I would strongly disagree with your statement that \"the salt crystals are not shiny\".  I've seen them both and the salt crystals are much shinier.  I've also seen the oxide film on the bottom of cars that I've had to scrape off before the car could be driven.  It's not a thin film.  It's thick enough to be noticeable, but not as thick as the paint.\n\nComment: @K7PEH  I'd also point out that the anode is the only part of the car that is exposed to the salt.  The rest of the car is under the layer of oxide.  So if you rinse off the salt, you wouldn't be washing away the oxide layer.  Of course, if you drive it home in the salt, it will rinse off the anode, so it won't be there for you to notice.\n\nComment: @K7PEH  I think that's why they put an anode on the bottom of the car.  They know that you're not going to wash it off.  It will just go away and no one will notice.  But they still get the benefit of the anode.\n\nComment: @JonCuster  I've seen the bottom of cars that have been out in the rain.  It's not a thin film.  It's thick enough to be noticeable, but not as thick as the paint.  You can't get a scraper under it.  I've also seen the bottom of cars that I've had to scrape off before the car could be driven.  I've also seen rust underneath the layer of oxide.\n\nComment: @JonCuster  I don't know what to tell you.  You're entitled to your opinion, but I've seen the bottom of cars that have been out in the rain.  It's not a thin film.  It's thick enough to be noticeable, but not as thick as the paint.

Maybe it's not the salt that's eating away the steel, but something else.\n\nComment: @JonCuster  It's eating away the steel.  It's not the salt that's eating away the steel.  It's something else.  I don't know what it is, but it's eating away the steel.\n\nComment: @K7PEH  I'm not sure if I'm getting through to you or not.  I don't think you're understanding what I'm trying to say.  The salt is eating away the steel.  It's not the salt that's eating away the steel.  It's something else.  I don't know what it is, but it's eating away the steel.\n\nComment: @JonCuster", "It's a complicated question, but the short answer is yes, it will help, but not a lot.\n\nThe principle of a sacrificial anode is that the anode will rust before the metal you want to protect, so if you put a sacrificial anode on the bottom of your car, it will rust long before the car. This is a good thing, because you want to protect your car from rust, not your anode.\n\nThere are several factors that affect how quickly a metal will rust. One is the \\em{corrosion potential} of the metal. The corrosion potential is the voltage that needs to be applied between the metal and a reference electrode to cause corrosion to start. You can think of it as the voltage that will drive the electrons onto the surface of the metal to start the corrosion reaction.\n\nThe principle of galvanic corrosion is that the metal with the lowest corrosion potential will corrode preferentially, and the metal with the highest corrosion potential will be protected. So, if you are using a sacrificial anode, the anode should have a lower corrosion potential than the metal you want to protect (the cathode).\n\nThe other factor is the \\em{galvanic series}. The galvanic series is a list of metals arranged in order of their corrosion potential. It goes zinc, magnesium, cadmium, aluminum, copper, nickel, iron, cobalt, lead, tin, silver, gold, platinum.\n\nThe first metals on the list (zinc, magnesium, cadmium, aluminum) will corrode preferentially and are good choices for sacrificial anodes. The problem is that they have a fairly low corrosion potential, so they won't last very long. The metal has to be able to withstand the corrosive environment.\n\nThe bottom of a car is not a very corrosive environment, so zinc, magnesium and cadmium would be good sacrificial anodes there.\n\nThe question is: How do you know what the corrosion potential is of the anode and the cathode? For this, you need an anodic polarization curve. The anodic polarization curve is a graph of the corrosion rate of the metal vs. the potential of the metal. A typical anodic polarization curve looks something like the following:\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B5lQE.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nThe anodic polarization curve shows two things:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The corrosion rate increases with increasing potential (i.e. the voltage you are applying)\n\\item The corrosion rate decreases as you approach the corrosion potential of the metal\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWhat you want is to be able to pick an anode that has a lower corrosion potential and a lower corrosion rate than the metal you want to protect.\n\nSo, for example, let's say you want to protect the bottom of your car which is steel. The steel is probably around 0.2 volts. If you pick an anode that is magnesium, the anodic polarization curve of magnesium looks like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXRPp.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><IMAGE></a>\n\nYou can see that the magnesium anode has a corrosion potential around 0.5 volts, so it will corrode preferentially to the steel and protect your car. But you can also see that the corrosion rate of magnesium is fairly high, so it won't last very long.\n\nSo, the key is to find an anode that has a lower corrosion potential and a lower corrosion rate than the metal you want to protect.\n\nComment: This is an excellent answer. I would only like to point out that it's not only the corrosion potential that matters - a galvanic couple is also defined by its corrosion potential (the one of the cathode) and the temperature of the electrolyte. The electrolyte can provide the energy for the redox process, and the higher the temperature, the easier it is to move electrons through the electrolyte. This is why zinc is used as a sacrificial anode in heat exchangers: the electrolyte is hot water.\n\nComment: @Lars", "Yes, attaching a sacrificial anode to the bottom of your car will help extend the life of the car.\n\nWhen a metal is immersed in a conductive electrolyte, the metal is the cathode and the electrolyte is the anode. Corrosion occurs when the anodic reaction is more favorable than the cathodic reaction. In the case of rust, the anode is oxygen and the cathode is the metal. Because the anode is more reactive, it will oxidize before the metal does (note: this is a simplification of the reaction). So, in order to stop rust, we want to ensure that the anode (the electrolyte) is more reactive than the metal (the cathode).\n\nThere are several ways to do this. One is to paint the metal, which will slow down the rate of corrosion. Another way is to replace the electrolyte by removing water, which will make the electrolyte less reactive. You can try to do this by using a deicer that does not contain chloride ions. Another way is to make the anode more reactive than the metal. This can be done by placing a sacrificial anode on the car. A sacrificial anode is a metal that is very reactive and will corrode first. For example, if you attach a piece of magnesium to the bottom of your car, it will corrode before your car.\n\nFinally, you can also increase the anode by making it more conductive. For example, if you put a layer of copper between the car and the electrolyte, the copper will oxidize before the car does.\n\nComment: Thank you. I had not thought about using a more conductive material as the anode.\n\nComment: The problem is, if you put copper between the car and the ground, the copper will quickly oxidize and you will be back to square one.\n\nComment: @DavePhD The copper is not in contact with the car. It is between the car and the ground.\n\nComment: Ah, I see.  That is quite clever.\n\nComment: @DavePhD I think the question was asking for a sacrificial anode, and this is a sacrificial anode.\n\nComment: @JustinL.: I'm afraid I don't understand what you're saying, but it appears that you're wrong.  This is not a sacrificial anode.  A sacrificial anode is a piece of metal that will be sacrificed to protect a more expensive piece of metal.  A sacrificial anode is not a metal that protects a metal.\n\nComment: @DavePhD Yes, sorry, I misread the question. I will edit my response.\n\nComment: @JustinL.: I'm afraid I still don't understand.  How is copper protecting the car?  Copper is corroding, and the car is not being protected.  Copper is not sacrificing itself to protect the car.  It is the car that is sacrificing itself to protect the copper.\n\nComment: @DavePhD You are right, I am not explaining it correctly. I will edit my answer.\n\nComment: @JustinL.: You're on the right track.  But I still don't think you're quite explaining it correctly.  The copper isn't protecting the car.  The car is protecting the copper.  The car is sacrificing itself to protect the copper.  (And, of course, the car is protecting the car.)\n\nComment: @DavePhD I think we are just splitting hairs here. The principle of a sacrificial anode is that it oxidizes first to protect the cathode. The way I was using the word sacrifice is that the car is sacrificing its own metal to protect the copper. I did not mean to say that the car is protecting the copper.\n\nComment: @JustinL.: I'm not splitting hairs.  I'm pointing out that you're wrong.  A sacrificial anode is a piece of metal that will be sacrificed to protect a more expensive piece of metal.  A sacrificial anode is not a metal that protects a metal.  Copper is not protecting the car.  The car is protecting the copper.  The car is sacrificing itself to protect the copper.\n\nComment: @DavePhD I have already changed my answer to say that the", "Not all metals will work - Zinc will work, aluminium (not Aluminium) will not.\n\nThe sacrifice of the anode takes place in a single electrochemical cell, the electrolyte being the water. This is why it works (the anode is sacrificed) and why it does not work (in this case, Aluminium is a noble metal, it will not sacrifice itself).\n\nThere are many good articles on the internet, here is one:\nhttp://www.seawatercorrosion.com/electrochemistry/electrochemistry.html"]}

An N/A (or even leaving it blank) implies that you didn't do well on the test or you didn't take it. So if you're trying to get into a graduate program, it may be a strike against you.\n\nComment: If it's optional, it's optional for a reason.

For example, you could say \"I did not take the standardized test(s) or did not receive a GPA.\" or \"I did not receive a GPA because I took [a different type of class].\"\n\nComment: Thank you for your response!

And if you can't get a job because you don't have test scores and a GPA, you're not going to be able to get a job with a generic \"I didn't put it in because I'm not required to\" explanation.

If you don't have test scores, I would say you should put \"No test scores\" in that box.\n\nI would not say that you should leave it blank, because that implies that you have a GPA and you're not telling them.  That's definitely not what you want to imply.\n\nAnswer: The best way to answer that question is to find out what the question means and answer it directly.\n\nIf the question is asking \\em{about} a GPA, and you don't have one, I would say that \"No GPA\" is a valid answer.  If the question is about \\em{giving} the GPA, then you can say \"N/A\" or \"Not applicable.\"", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIf a job application asks for standardized test scores and cumulative GPA, can I just put N/A or will it hurt my candidacy?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo, you cannot do this.  This information is necessary for the university to determine if you have a GPA and test score that is comparable to that of their existing faculty members.  If not, you probably would be a poor fit for that position as you would have a \"higher\" standard to meet.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nI have 5 years of postdoc experience, 40 papers, 1 book chapter, and 1 book.

That's an average of 8 papers per year.  While this is certainly commendable, this is below the average for most faculty members (who are expected to publish 2-3 papers per year).\n\nComment: But postdocs work on other people's projects and papers, so it's difficult to judge their productivity.\n\nComment: @user1452285 - This is why they ask for the GPA and test scores.  If they're not comparable to the existing faculty, they know you won't be able to maintain that pace.\n\nComment: I think this is right.  Just because you have 5 years of postdoc experience and 40 papers doesn't mean you have good productivity.  Many people spend their first few years in postdocs not publishing anything at all, or just one or two papers.  Some people don't publish anything in postdoc because they start a new job.  I think a better way to compare applicants is by looking at the number of papers per year, not the number of years.\n\nComment: I'll add that I also have 2-3 collaborators right now.\n\nComment: @user1452285 - It's good to know that you have collaborators.  You can certainly add this to your CV if you think it will make a difference.  However, I would caution that it's not necessarily something that a committee would want to see.  They're more likely to be concerned about what you've done on your own.\n\nComment: So, does that mean that I have to reapply to the same position (with better numbers) next year?\n\nComment: @user1452285 - I don't know that you *have* to reapply, but you need to be realistic.  I'm not sure how many postdoc years you have left, but if you're still 2-3 years away from being a full professor, you might want to consider applying for a tenure-track position.\n\nComment: I have 5 years of postdoc experience.\n\nComment: @user1452285 - I'm not sure if I should ask this, but are you currently employed?  If so, at a postdoc position?\n\nComment: @user1452285 - If you have 5 years of postdoc experience and 40 papers, I'm not sure why your job search is taking so long.  I suggest that you contact the hiring committees and ask for feedback on why you're not being selected.  If you're not getting any offers, it could be that your numbers are just not good enough to get a position at the level you're applying for.  However, it could also be that you need to apply to schools that are a better fit for you.\n\nAnswer: I'm not a faculty member nor a hiring committee member, but my impression is that the GPA and test scores are used to assess the fit of your academic record with the average record of the existing faculty members.  If your record is similar to theirs, then they need not worry about whether you will be able to handle the teaching load, administrative requirements, etc.  If your record is much better than theirs, they will wonder whether you will be able to find enough challenging work to do.  If your record is much worse than theirs, they will worry that you won't be able to handle the teaching load, etc.\n\nMost people on hiring committees (but not all) are aware of the fact that grad", "\\strong{Yes, you can put N/A.}\n\nThe question is whether your application will be hurt by putting N/A.\n\nI would say that it will not be.\n\nIn my experience, the only time standardized test scores and cumulative GPA are considered in hiring is when they are considered to be a strong indicator of the applicant's fitness for the position. For example, in academia, an applicant with a 3.8 GPA and a 320 GRE score is likely to be considered to have a higher chance of success than one with a 2.8 GPA and a 320 GRE score.\n\nIn the private sector, however, this is not necessarily true. An applicant with a 2.8 GPA and a 320 GRE score may be more qualified for the position than one with a 3.8 GPA and a 320 GRE score, simply because the job requirements are more likely to involve non-standardized skills that are more important than GPA and GRE score.\n\nIn other words, if you do not have standardized test scores and/or a cumulative GPA, your application will not be hurt by putting N/A.\n\nComment: Can you support your claim that putting \"N/A\" would not hurt your candidacy?\n\nComment: @BryanKrause I edited in a bit more detail to support this claim.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer. I think this is good to know. I'm just worried that they will automatically disqualify me because I don't have the scores."]}

A firing can be unjustified, but it's not always illegal, and so there are generally grounds for a lawsuit.

I was just being careful with my wording, and wanted to avoid a misleading statement.\n\nComment: I am not a lawyer, but I think that there is more to it than that. If the person is \"asked\" to resign, and if they do so, there is no reason to give them severance, but if they are fired, they are probably entitled to it.\n\nComment: @HoboSapiens, in some jurisdictions, the \"asked to resign\" is considered a firing, and they are entitled to severance.  I don't know if that applies to OP's situation.\n\nComment: @jwg, I have never heard of severance being paid for a resignation.  I think that you are confused about how that would work.\n\nComment: @HoboSapiens, I'm not confused.  I know a few places where that's policy.  Also, I've seen a few cases in which a person was asked to resign, then later fired for the same reason, and got severance, because the resignation was considered a firing.\n\nAnswer: I think they are trying to avoid a firing and the stigma it carries, and they are using the \"asked to resign\" method to get you gone quickly.  They may be hoping you will take the hint and quit (I wouldn't).\n\nHaving said that, I think you need to be careful about how you handle this.  While I agree with the other answer about not worrying about being sued, the company could very well decide to fire you, and then you could be in a situation where you are ineligible for unemployment because you quit your last job.  This is especially the case if you have been with the company for more than a year.  I'm not sure if this is the case in your state, but it's something to consider.\n\nAnswer: I can't speak legally, but I do know that when I was laid off I was asked to leave the next day - and I didn't have to sign anything.  And, I was given a generous severance package, which was not contingent upon signing anything.\n\nThat said, I've never been asked to resign.  But I have a hunch that if you're still being asked to resign and you don't quit, the next day you'll be told to leave.\n\nAnswer: Resigning is not the same as being fired.\n\nEven if that were not the case, they can't ask you to resign.

You're free to refuse and they'll have to lay you off.\n\nComment: @ShaunaCulbertson It is not unusual for a company to require the person to quit rather than let them be laid off.

Maybe a few peppercorns or some garlic.\n\nAnswer: I know you said you wanted to add something other than cream to the sauce, but I have to say that I love a cream based sauce for gnocchi.  It makes it really light and fluffy.  If you want to add something else, you could go with a sauce that uses some sort of red bell pepper.

However, I'm not sure if you're talking about the law of the location where the conversation took place. 2 party consent is the law of the state, not the location.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - The question doesn't say where the conversation took place. It says the employee was \"caught\" recording a conversation, and the conversation took place in a restaurant \"after closing with the doors locked.\" It doesn't say anything about the employees actions after the conversation. So it's not clear whether the conversation was recorded then, or later. But I would guess that the employee recorded it later, so the law of the state would apply.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz I think he's talking about the law of the state where the conversation took place.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - I don't mean to be argumentative, but I stand by what I said. The question says he was \"caught\" recording the conversation, which implies that the conversation took place at a time when the employee was recording it. So if the conversation took place in that restaurant, then the laws of the state where the restaurant is located would apply.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - But, of course, the question doesn't say that. So I would guess that the employee recorded the conversation at a later time. If so, then the laws of the state where the employee was when he recorded the conversation would apply.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - I think there's a third option, which is that the conversation took place in the restaurant, the employee recorded it later, and the recording was made in a state that doesn't have a 2-party consent law. Of course, that would make a difference to whether the OP could legally record the conversation, but not whether the employee could legally record the conversation.\n\nComment: @WayneWerner You have me convinced. I'm not sure how the OP could record it (assuming he was in the same state), but I think I understand the reasoning now.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - To make a recording, the OP would have to be in the same room as the employee at the time the recording was made. So if the OP was in another state, he couldn't make the recording.\n\nComment: @WayneWerner I guess he could have sent a messenger to the employee to deliver a recording device.\n\nComment: @DavidSchwartz - Yes, that is possible.\n\nComment: @WayneWerner - I believe the OP is talking about a state where two-party consent is the law.  The question is unclear, but I believe OP is using \"right\" to mean permission, or in other words, legal.  So, I am assuming the OP is in a state where two-party consent is the law, and the employee is the one who recorded the conversation.\n\nComment: @CraigS - I think you are correct. The OP said the employee recorded a conversation \"right in front of me\", which I took to mean that the employee recorded the conversation while the OP was in the same location as the employee.

That means the employee has notice of the incident and an opportunity to be heard about it.\n\nComment: I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or not, but yes, a disciplinary procedure is a must, especially if the employee is in a protected class. It would be unlawful to terminate a pregnant employee (for example) without notice, even if you saw her steal from the cash register.\n\nComment: @JasonBass - I was not being sarcastic.  It's a good idea to make sure that things like that are done the right way, even if you have a strong case against the employee.\n\nAnswer: Generally you would need to give the employee notice of the problem, and an opportunity to explain or defend themselves.  In this case you can't say he committed some crime, and that you saw him commit the crime.\n\nIn most states the employee would be entitled to be notified and informed of the problem, and given a chance to explain or defend himself.\n\nIn some states the employee has a right to union representation in such a meeting.\n\nIn a \"right to work\" state, the employee can choose not to be represented by the union in such a meeting.\n\nThe employer is not required to continue the employment relationship with the employee if they are going to fire the employee because of the meeting.\n\nThe employer can say, \"I don't think you should continue working here because of the meeting.\"  The employer could also say, \"I think you should be fired because of the meeting\", but the employee could say \"I don't want to be fired, I want to continue working here.  I will not be fired because of the meeting.\"\n\nComment: This is a good answer, but I'm not sure I would describe the right to participate in the grievance process as a \"right to union representation,\" especially regarding an individual meeting.  I also might have emphasized that the disciplinary meeting should be conducted by someone other than the employer who observed the alleged misconduct.  Otherwise, this is pretty good.\n\nComment: @Anne - I think in this case you shouldn't be fired.  In this case the problem would be \"disrespectful, rude, and insubordinate behavior\" towards the employer.  The employer's witnessing and participation in the alleged misconduct would be considered evidence of the misconduct.\n\nComment: @JasonBass - I don't see how the employer could participate in the alleged misconduct.  I would describe a disciplinary meeting as a \"meeting to discuss alleged misconduct\", but I don't see how the employer could be accused of participating in the misconduct.  If the employer was seen to be participating in the misconduct, I would not be surprised if that participation was not seen as evidence of the misconduct.\n\nComment: @Anne - I mean if you were recording someone secretly without their permission, you would have been participating in their misconduct.  I'm not sure if it would be the same as a regular work situation.  But if I were the employer, I would not take the chance and would not participate in the alleged misconduct.\n\nComment: @Anne - you are correct, I was being sarcastic.  Thanks for the correction.\n\nComment: I think the reason I was confused is because the employee wasn't recording the employer, the employer was recording the employee.  I might have been more clear if I had mentioned that.\n\nAnswer: It is not appropriate to give notice to an employee when they have just been caught in the act of breaking the law.\n\nYou could just fire them on the spot, but that is not a good idea.  First of all, you don't have to do that.  Second of all, even if you do, the employee could claim that they were fired for some other reason.  Third of all, you don't want an employee to go around saying \"they fired me on the spot for no reason.\"\n\nYou should provide notice and a hearing before firing an employee.  You should also follow procedures for termination, like providing notice and paying or offering severance pay or whatever else.\n\nIt would be better to give an employee notice and a hearing before firing them.  You should also follow procedures for termination, like providing notice", "IANAL, but in many states, especially California, an employer cannot fire an employee for breaking the law.\n\nThe argument is that the employee is breaking the law at the company's direction, and thus the company is liable for the violation.\n\nAnswer: In a two party consent state, you could technically sue the employee for violating your privacy, if you feel the conversation was confidential or private.  However, since you were both in the same place, it would be hard to establish the privacy issue.\n\nIf you terminated the employee for this reason, I suspect the employee's attorney would file a claim that the termination was illegal, and the employee would be reinstated.\n\nThere would be no legal consequences for the employee.  The employee may be subject to discipline for violating company policy, but I doubt the company would want to go to that trouble.  It would be easier for the company to just fire the employee for cause.  The employee would be out of a job, but they would be entitled to unemployment benefits.\n\nComment: I don't think OP is talking about the employee violating his privacy. He's saying that the employee violated the law by recording without OP's permission.\n\nComment: @jamesqf -  I did not say that the employee recorded the conversation without the OP's permission.

If you can't record a conversation without the consent of both parties, then you wouldn't be able to record a conversation that only you are participating in.  You'd have to get the other person's consent, even if he's not there.  How can the law be that stupid?  That's what I'm trying to understand.\n\nComment: I'm not sure why you're so adamant about defending the employee.  He's the one that committed the crime, not me.\n\nComment: @JimmySanta: I'm not defending the employee.  I'm trying to help you understand the law.  I'm not a lawyer, but the law is not as stupid as you seem to think it is.\n\nComment: You're not understanding the law.  You're just repeating what you read somewhere.  The law says that I can't record anyone without their consent.  That is the law.\n\nComment: @JimmySanta: I'm not repeating anything.  I'm not a lawyer, but I'm not going to make assumptions about what the law says based on your misinterpretation of it.  The law says that you need the consent of one of the participants.  It doesn't say that you need the consent of both of the participants.\n\nComment: I'm not going to argue this with you anymore.  If you want to do this to yourself, then have at it.\n\nComment: @JimmySanta: You're the one that posted the question.

I'm not going to let you post a", "\\section{You can fire the employee for the act of recording you, but it will be difficult to prove}\n\nGenerally, two-party consent states require the consent of both parties before a conversation can be recorded.  Most often, this takes the form of an explicit statement by one party asking the other to record the conversation.  But states will also allow the use of \"implied consent,\" where the circumstances make it obvious to everyone that the conversation is being recorded.  This is typically limited to situations where the conversation is taking place in a public place where it's normal to be recorded (such as a store or a restaurant).  But there are also cases where a court will allow \"constructive consent\" where the circumstances are such that it was obvious to the other party that the conversation was about to be recorded.  This can happen in a hotel room, for instance, where a hidden camera is visible to the other party.\n\nIn this situation, it's not clear that the employee had the intent to record the conversation, and it's certainly not clear that the employee knew that he was recording you, which is required for \"constructive consent.\"  So unless you somehow manage to get the employee to confess, you could find yourself in a difficult legal position.\n\nYou could also be in a difficult legal position if you fired the employee for something that he wasn't actually doing.  You can't fire someone for something he didn't do, and it's unlikely that you'd have any other evidence that the employee was even recording.  You could claim that he was constructively recorded, but if you can't prove that, then you've created a situation where you're basing your decision on the word of one employee against the word of another.  That's an extremely difficult situation to be in, and in a lot of states, you could end up being sued for defamation or wrongful termination.\n\n\\section{You \\em{might} be able to fire the employee for another reason}\n\nThere are some states that allow a one-party consent recording to be used.  In a one-party consent state, you can record a conversation without the other person's express permission, but you \\em{must} inform the other party that you're recording the conversation.\n\nIt's not clear that this would apply to your situation.  You say that the employee recorded you in a \"restaurant after closing with the doors locked,\" which implies that the employee was the only person in the restaurant.  In that case, he would have had to tell you that the conversation was being recorded, which he didn't do.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that you were in the restaurant with the employee, and you just didn't realize that he was recording you.  In that case, it's possible that he did inform you, and just didn't inform you that the conversation was being recorded.  (It's also possible that he didn't inform you at all, but that would fall under the one-party consent rules for a \"public place\" recording.)\n\n\\section{You should talk to an employment law attorney}\n\nUltimately, the best thing you can do is talk to an employment law attorney.  They will be able to tell you exactly what the law is in your state, and if you have a good case, they can even represent you in a lawsuit."]}

But the ancient Greeks did not create a civilization.  That was done by the Minoan and Mycenaean cultures.\n\nComment: Fairly close = not too different, not too similar. I wasn't talking about the creation of civilization. I was talking about the creation of the Greek language.\n\nComment: The most significant genetic difference between ancient and modern Greeks is the difference between the Eteocretans and Eteocretans.  The Eteocretans immigrated to Greece from Crete around 2000 BCE.  The Eteocretans are the people who created the Greek language.  Modern Greeks are genetically very similar to the Eteocretans.  My point is that the ancient Greeks were a very small fraction of the population of Greece.  Most of the population of Greece today has been in Greece for many centuries, and is not descended from the ancient Greeks.\n\nComment: @reirab I was thinking about the Greek War of Independence.\n\nComment: The Greek War of Independence was in the 1820s.  There were no pure-blooded ancient Greeks in the Greek War of Independence.  They were all mixed-breed.  The Greek War of Independence was a revolution against the Ottoman Empire.  The Ottoman Empire ruled Greece for about 400 years.  Before that, the Ottoman Empire ruled Greece for about 200 years.  There were not very many Eteocretans left in Crete by that time.  The Eteocretans had been absorbed into the main stream of Greek culture centuries before.\n\nComment: @reirab \"The Greek War of Independence was in the 1820s.\"  No, it started in 1821.\n\nComment: @reirab \"There were no pure-blooded ancient Greeks in the Greek War of Independence.\"  Of course there were.  They were descendants of people who had been in Greece for centuries.", "\\strong{It's very complicated.}\n\nModern Greeks are very different from the ancient Greeks, and it is quite hard to figure out how close they are. According to this [article](http://www.newsweek.com/myths-and-realities-greek-genetics-88116):\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\"The ancient Greeks were also more different from each other than modern Greeks are. The genes of ancient Minoans, for example, were a mix of European and Near Eastern.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n[This article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/genetic-analysis-suggests-mycenaean-greeks-had-european-ancestry) also says:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n...\u201cThe Mycenaean population represents a distinctive and unique population that is more closely related to other ancient European populations than to contemporary Greek ones,\u201d the researchers write.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nHere is a study [published in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v548/n7668/full/nature23321.html) which found that:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nAncient DNA from Greece reveals genetic continuity from the Neolithic to the present.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nBut, as you can see from the article above, the DNA of the ancient Greeks is quite different from that of the modern ones.\n\nHere is [another article](http://www.heritagedaily.com/2017/03/ancient-dna-shows-european-migrations-and-genetic-continuity-in-greece-from-the-neolithic-to-the-present/115461) which seems to be saying the opposite:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nAncient DNA has revealed that European migrations and genetic continuity in Greece from the Neolithic to the present day.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSo, it is hard to be certain whether ancient Greeks and modern Greeks are ethnically close.\n\nComment: Is there any research on the ethnicity of the Minoans?\n\nComment: @sempaiscuba Actually, Minoans are the same ethnicity as modern Greeks, since they were the first people who lived in modern Greece.\n\nComment: What do you mean by \"first people\"? I assume you don't mean the first people to live there since the first person, which would be absurd.\n\nAnswer: As the others pointed out, Greece was conquered by the Romans, Goths, Huns, Arabs, Normans, and finally the Ottoman Empire. This was followed by a period of Greek independence and then occupation by Germany in the two world wars. There were also various smaller ethnic groups in Greece in the past, some of which had almost disappeared, such as the Macedonians.\n\nIn short, the ancient Greeks were ethnically different from modern Greeks.", "There is a huge genetic continuity between ancient and modern Greeks, but the cultural difference is huge.\n\nThe genetic continuity is due to the fact that the ancient Greeks had an overwhelming influence on the rest of human history. This is particularly true for the Western world. The Western world is basically a European empire built on top of a Greek foundation.\n\nWhile ancient Greek culture was very advanced by the standards of its time, it had nothing to do with modern Western culture. The ancient Greeks were not democratic, they were not capitalist, they did not have a market economy, they did not have modern science, they did not have a modern concept of human rights, etc.\n\nComment: I have the same problem with the ancient Romans. They have a huge influence on our culture and the modern world, but the culture is completely different.\n\nComment: @Snijderfrey: Yes, a similar thing happened to the ancient Greeks. They were conquered by Alexander the Great, who then became king of the ancient Greeks. This is the equivalent of how the ancient Romans were conquered by Julius Caesar. Alexander then conquered the Persian Empire, which is the equivalent of how the Romans conquered the ancient Carthaginian Empire."]}
{"prompt": "Has any research been done on whatleads to or is correlated with successful long distance relationships?", "response_list": ["There are several studies on this topic.

The more often people meet each other in\n  different situations, the more likely it is that they will develop a\n  friendship (Sussman, 1976). Because of the high population density in\n  cities, the likelihood of meeting people is greater in cities than in\n  rural areas.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nEssentially, the more people you meet, the more likely you are to develop a friendship with one of them.\n\nIt's probably not surprising that distance affects the likelihood of developing a friendship. What is surprising is how much distance affects friendship. It's not just that more people have a long-distance friend than a short-distance friend, it's that the \\em{average distance} between friends is increasing over time. From the same article:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n...the average distance between friends has increased from 0.6 to 1.4\n  miles over the past 30 years (Konrath et al., 2003). This is\n  particularly surprising since the average distance between friends\n  increased between 1985 and 2004 even though the population density\n  of the United States has been decreasing.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWhile I don't doubt that geography does play a role in the strength of a relationship, there are other things that are more important:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nSocial support is a well-known predictor of well-being. A review by\n  House, Landis, and Umberson (1988) found that those with social\n  support have lower levels of disease, higher life satisfaction, and\n  healthier ways of coping with stress than those without social\n  support. In addition, social support has been found to be a\n  significant predictor of recovery from serious illness (Folkman\n  & Lazarus, 1984; House et al., 1988; Stephens et al., 1985).\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nComment: This is good, but I don't think I asked the right question.

If the foundation is not strong enough, then the relationship will not last. Many people try to keep in touch with their long distance partners through email, texting, Skype, and other forms of communication. While these are all good forms of communication, they are not going to keep a relationship going. It takes more than just talking on the phone to keep a relationship going.

The fact is that the US government has been using and training psychopaths for hundreds of years.\n\nTheir training is thorough and involves the use of drugs and other mind control techniques.  A good example of this is the MK Ultra program.   The US military is very good at what they do.\n\nMost of the troops are also recruited from the lower economic classes.  These are people that have no money and no property.  Many of them are also victims of abuse from the time they were children.\n\nSo, in essence, they are being paid to commit murder and to help the government commit crimes against humanity.  It is also a very good way to wipe out the lower classes that might someday rise up against the government.\n\nThe US military is very good at what they do.  They are able to recruit and train the most vicious of psychopaths.

You would be amazed at how many people in various fields of work are capable of doing whatever it takes to get a paycheck.  So, the question really is why would a soldier not follow orders?  One answer is that they might not be able to justify it to themselves and therefore would not be able to do it.  Another answer is that they might not be able to justify it to others and therefore they would not be able to do it.  In other words, it could be a combination of the individual soldier's morals and/or their fear of what others might think.

Many of them are still young enough to be living at home, and many are probably coming from a relatively sheltered and controlled environment.\n\nThe military is their first taste of a real job. They are being asked to do things they never done before, in environments they never been to before. That's a lot for anyone to take, and it's a lot for a military commander to ask of untrained soldiers.\n\nAnd so the military has a lot of training protocols in place to prepare the soldiers for the situations they might face. They have extensive protocols for how to react to certain situations and to deal with certain individuals.\n\nBut these protocols are often very complex and very detailed. And so, for the most part, the soldiers simply have to follow along. For example, in the case of the soldiers you mention:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nAn officer gives the soldiers orders to kill everyone in sight.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nSoldiers are often given very specific orders. The orders are given verbally and can be very complex. Often, a soldier will need to write them down or have them repeated several times.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nA group of soldiers blindly follow the orders and shoot people in the streets.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWhen soldiers are given orders, they are supposed to carry them out. They are \\strong{not} supposed to question them. The whole idea of a military is to instill a sense of discipline and to follow orders.\n\nSo, to the point, if a soldier is given an order to shoot someone, he is \\strong{supposed to shoot the person}. He's not supposed to ask questions, and he's not supposed to question the order. The military has a long history of using discipline and training to make sure that people follow their orders.\n\nThe other element of the situation you mention is the culture of the military. Soldiers, by and large, are trained to trust their higher-ups. That's part of the culture of the military. Soldiers are trained to follow orders, and to follow orders blindly.\n\nAnd that's a difficult thing to overturn. Soldiers are trained to follow military protocols and it's very difficult for them to start second-guessing their orders.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhy do the soldiers blindly listen the orders to kill innocent people in foreign countries instead of just self-organizing and killing a few psychopaths that gave such orders?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n\\strong{Discipline}, \\strong{loyalty}, and \\strong{orders}.\n\nYou're not supposed to just kill \"psychopaths\" who give such orders.

Their training is intended to eliminate any doubts they have about obeying orders.  The orders may even go against their own natural instincts.\n\nThe idea is that soldiers obey orders without question, so if they are told to kill civilians, they will do it.  If they don't, they're likely to be killed by the people they're supposed to be fighting.\n\nAnswer: Because the soldiers are trained to obey orders without question. The military is very strict about this.\n\nComment: This is not true.  Many soldiers do not obey orders without question.  They are trained to obey the orders that are legal and not immoral, but the military has a history of forcing soldiers to obey illegal orders.\n\nComment: @SirAdams: I'd call that an *unintended* consequence of the strict discipline.\n\nComment: The soldiers are trained to follow orders without question, but there is a limit.

I do not consider killing to be a good thing, but at the same time I don't think I would go against an order to kill if that order came from an authority.\n\nAnswer: This is a real world answer:\n\nThe military is a big organization with lots of levels of authority. In the lower levels, it is easier to see the difference between the orders you are given and the orders you are expected to follow. But in the upper levels, this distinction becomes fuzzier. The orders become more abstract and harder to directly see how they relate to the real world.\n\nIn the case of the US, it is unlikely that one of the top generals would give the order to kill innocents. If they did, it is likely they would have to be very careful about how they did it. They might not say \"kill innocents\", but instead say \"attack the enemy\". In this case, the lower level commanders might see that as just an order to attack, and not to think about it any further.\n\nThere are several ways that the lower level commanders might see the order and not think about it. One is that they might not know anything about the order. They might not know anything about the order, and they might not be interested in thinking about the order. Another way is that they might not be thinking about the order, but it might be that they don't think about it because they think they know what it means.\n\nThe military is a big organization with lots of levels of authority.

That is why soldiers are so compliant.  It is in their self-interest to obey their leaders.  If they do not, they face being court-martialed and thrown in prison (with the possibility of death).\n\nIf they do not like the idea of being imprisoned and/or killed for disobeying orders, they do their best to obey their leaders.  That is why their leaders are able to tell them to go kill innocent people.\n\nAnswer: There are two reasons, the first is the fact that they are ordered to follow the orders of their superiors. These orders are not questioned by most of them. The second is the fact that they are trained to obey the orders and not look into the background of the order.\n\nThe US army is not as compliant as you might think. There are soldiers who have refused to serve in the Iraq war and have been imprisoned because of it. There are soldiers who are outraged by the behaviour of the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan and who have even committed suicide when they returned home.

You are only now seeing it, but there are thousands of examples. The US has a long history of soldiers refusing to fight, going AWOL, deserting, etc. The military is a large force, and it is large enough that it has some of everything.\n\nComment: Yes, of course.

They are also trained to obey orders from their superiors, and not to question those orders.  They are trained that it's their duty to follow the orders of their superiors.  They are also trained that it's their duty to kill anyone that they are ordered to kill.  So, it's no surprise that they follow their orders.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the soldiers are not aware of what they are doing.  They are.  They are also aware of the consequences of their actions.  For the most part, they are not aware of the reasons for their actions.\n\nAnswer: There's a few reasons.\n\nOne is that they have been trained to follow orders, and they see no reason to not do so.\n\nAnother is that they are conditioned to think that there will be consequences for not following orders.\n\nAnother is the fact that they are trained to trust their superiors."]}

So you're saying that just because we can ask the big questions, we don't have to. That's fine and I agree with it. But what I'm asking is, if we do ask, will we ever find an answer?\n\nComment: @dave, no, unless the answer is \"no\" or \"no, not really\".\n\nComment: I suspect the answer is that you can't answer such a question definitively.\n\nComment: @M.A.Rothman: I'm not sure what you are saying. Are you saying that the question is unanswerable, or are you saying that you can't answer it definitively? Because I think that question is unanswerable, which is not the same thing as saying that you can't answer it definitively.\n\nComment: @Rex Kerr: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be confusing. I was trying to say that you can't answer the question definitively, as opposed to something like \"No, we don't know what the meaning of life is, or if it exists\" which is just a statement that it's unknowable.\n\nComment: @M.A.Rothman: I think that the difference between the two is just one of degree, and that there is no fundamental difference between them.\n\nComment: @Rex Kerr: I certainly agree that they are very similar, and I have a hard time imagining a situation where someone would be able to say \"Yes, life has a meaning\" with any sort of certainty.\n\nComment: You might be confusing \"life\" with \"the meaning of life\".\n\nComment: @RexKerr: I was thinking that if you have a question, you are compelled to answer it. If it has no answer, you are compelled to say that it has no answer. I guess I meant \"compelled\" in the sense of \"compared\".\n\nComment: @RexKerr: If life has no meaning, then we are compelled to say that it has no meaning. If it has meaning, then we are compelled to answer the question.\n\nComment: @M.A.Rothman: I'm still not sure I see the distinction you are making. I'm not sure that I fully understand the question you are posing. Could you give an example?\n\nAnswer: I think it depends on your definition of \"meaning\" in the first place.\n\nIf the meaning of life is \"to procreate\", then yes, we are compelled to procreate.\n\nIf the meaning of life is \"to be happy\", then it is not compulsory that we be happy.  It's compulsory that we pursue happiness, but we can choose to be unhappy.\n\nIf the meaning of life is \"to be loved\", then it is not compulsory that we be loved.  It's compulsory that we pursue love, but we can choose to be unloved.\n\nSo you can choose to be unhappy, unloved, and childless, but you will still have to pursue happiness, love, and procreation.\n\nTo answer your question more directly, though, I don't think we are compelled to ponder the meaning of life, but we are compelled to do something with our lives.  And the question of \"what should we do with our lives\" is the question of \"what is the meaning of life\".\n\nComment: I like it, but I'm not sure I fully understand it. You're saying that we are compelled to pursue happiness, love, and procreation. But why? If you're saying that we are pursuing it to find meaning, then why do we have to find meaning? Isn't happiness, love, and procreation enough of a meaning?\n\nComment: Well, I don't believe in a God, so I don't believe in a God's purpose or a God's meaning, so I'm not pursuing it to find a higher meaning.  I'm pursuing happiness, love, and procreation because", "No, not necessarily.\n\nComment: I am not sure that this answer is true, but I am not sure that it is not true.\n\nComment: @R.vanDobbendeBruyn I'm not sure that it's true either, but the alternative is that we're compelled to ponder the meaning of life despite the fact that life has no meaning, and that's a bit too dark for my taste!\n\nComment: This is a good answer.  People tend to think that if life has no meaning it is meaningless, but that is not true.  For example, without meaning, life has no meaning.\n\nComment: @R.vanDobbendeBruyn Yes, it's a tautology. There is a good answer to that specific objection, but I'm not sure that there's a good answer to the more general \"life has no meaning\" objection.\n\nComment: I think the answer to the original question is that we are compelled to ponder the meaning of life because we want to avoid the possibility that life has no meaning.\n\nComment: That's a good point.\n\nAnswer: It's not an either-or situation:\n\nIt's possible that there is no purpose to life, yet we are compelled to look for it.\n\nFor example, suppose you're walking along the street and you see a penny that seems to be shining so brightly that it looks like it could be a quarter. You're compelled to pick it up to see if it's a quarter. After you collect it, you discover that it's not a quarter and that it was just a penny.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the penny was necessarily a quarter, but rather that it was worth picking up.\n\nSimilarly, we're compelled to look for a meaning of life, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there is one.\n\nAnswer: I find this to be an interesting topic. I have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as meaning, so I guess the answer to your question is No.\n\nComment: This would be a better answer if you explained how there can be no meaning if we are compelled to ponder it.\n\nComment: Because meaning can only be a word, and words are just sounds. Everything is just sounds. So there is no meaning.\n\nComment: You can't get meaning from sounds unless you're able to understand the sounds that are being said.\n\nComment: I'm not sure I agree with you. Meaning is a concept, not a word. If you're saying that we think about meaning because we're compelled to think about sound, then I don't understand.\n\nComment: I think you are right, but I don't think that's what he is saying.\n\nComment: Meaning is a concept that, when applied to life, is a word. I think you are right that we are compelled to think about meaning because we are compelled to think about sound.\n\nComment: @R.vanDobbendeBruyn I'm not saying that we think about meaning because we think about sound. I'm saying that there is no such thing as meaning. So even though we are compelled to look for meaning, there is none to be found.\n\nComment: @CodyBugstein, you are right, I was wrong. I don't see how there can be no meaning, unless you mean that there is no real meaning, only an illusion of meaning.\n\nComment: @R.vanDobbendeBruyn I would say that there is no meaning, only the illusion of meaning.\n\nComment: I think that there is no meaning, but that that is not the same as saying that there is no meaning, only the illusion of meaning.\n\nComment: @R.vanDobbendeBruyn Well, I guess it depends on how you define meaning. If you define meaning as a concept, then there's no such thing as meaning. If you define meaning as the word meaning, then there is such a thing as meaning.\n\nComment: @CodyBugstein I think that you are right, but I don't think that it is that simple.\n\nAnswer: I think that the question is a good one, but I think that the answer would be that it is not necessarily so.\n\nFor example, suppose that there is no meaning to life, but you are compelled to think about life as having a meaning, even though it does not.", "No, not at all. That's the whole point.\n\nComment: Thanks for the answer, but I still don't understand. If I have a compulsion to eat, does that mean that food definitely has a compelling property?\n\nComment: I think this answers the question. It's not that life has a meaning, but that we have a compulsion to think about meaning. That we have a compulsion to think about meaning doesn't mean that life has a meaning. That is to say, life has no meaning, but we still feel a compulsion to think about meaning.\n\nComment: That's not even close to the answer, and I find it hard to believe that you really think your answer is correct. You're not even addressing the question.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\n\nIf we are, by nature, compelled to ponder the meaning of life, does that mean that life definitely has a meaning?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nIf we are, by nature, compelled to ponder the meaning of life, does that mean that life definitely has a meaning?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nNo.\n\nComment: +1 A great answer, but unfortunately it doesn't answer the question.\n\nComment: I think it does - the question is \"does it mean that life definitely has a meaning\", and I said \"no\".\n\nComment: I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I don't think you've provided a reason for your answer.\n\nComment: @DaveLRenfro I don't see the question as \"why is it that life definitely has a meaning\", but rather \"if we are compelled to ponder the meaning of life, does that mean that life definitely has a meaning?\". I think the answer to that is \"no\" for the reasons I've given.\n\nComment: @BenjaminDriscall I'm not sure where you're getting that from. We have the compulsion to ponder the meaning of life.

What element would yield the biggest result?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nA nuclear bomb is not made from one element. It is a combination of a fissionable and a fusionable element. For example, a typical hydrogen bomb uses a fissionable material, usually uranium, and a fusionable material, usually hydrogen.\n\nThe fission of uranium releases neutrons, which are absorbed by the hydrogen to form helium and energy. The fusion produces an explosion, and heat, which detonates the fissionable material, which produces more neutrons, which are absorbed by the hydrogen to form helium and energy, and so on.\n\nThe power of a nuclear bomb is not determined by the volume of fissionable material, but by the amount of fissionable material that will be converted to fissionable material by the detonation of the nuclear bomb. This is called the critical mass.\n\nYou can make a fission bomb from plutonium, for example, but the critical mass of plutonium is much greater than the critical mass of uranium. This is why plutonium bombs are not used very often. They require a large amount of fissionable material to be converted to fissionable material.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\nWhat element would yield the biggest result?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThis is a very difficult question to answer. There are many different elements that can be used in a nuclear bomb. The answer depends on many factors, including the size of the bomb, the type of bomb, and the type of fissionable material.\n\nIn general, the heavier the element, the more powerful the bomb. However, this is not always the case. For example, a bomb made from uranium-235 will be more powerful than a bomb made from uranium-238.\n\nThe best way to find out what element would yield the biggest result is to experiment. You can build a nuclear bomb using different elements and see which one yields the most energy.\n\nComment: I know the difference, but I am referring to the volume of the explosion.\n\nComment: The volume of the explosion is not determined by the volume of the fissionable material.

The amount of energy released in a nuclear explosion is related to the binding energy of the nucleus. This is given by\n$$\nE_{bind} = \\sum_i Z_i^2 \\langle r_i^2 \\rangle  - \\sum_i Z_i \\langle r_i \\rangle^2,\n$$\nwhere the sum goes over all the nucleons in the nucleus and the two terms are the average total kinetic energy of the nucleons and the average total potential energy of the nucleons. The first term is obviously proportional to the volume of the nucleus, and the second is inversely proportional to the volume of the nucleus.\n\nThus, on average, larger nuclei have more binding energy, and thus will be more energetic in nuclear explosions.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat element would yield the biggest result?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe largest naturally occurring nucleus is an \\strong{island of stability} of bismuth, with $Z = 83$ and $N = 128$.

The potential energy is only $A^{1/3}$ so the potential energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nAnswer: The binding energy per nucleon of the nucleus increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$ as $A$ increases. The potential energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nThe potential energy per nucleon can be expressed in terms of the nuclear force constant as\n$$\n\\frac{V}{N} = (Z\\alpha)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m} \\frac{1}{r_0}\n$$\nwhere $r_0$ is the nuclear force constant.\n\nThe nuclear force constant can be related to the mass of the nucleus as\n\n$$\nr_0 = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mZ\\alpha^2}\n$$\nThis is known as the Thomas-Fermi model.\n\nThe potential energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$\n\nThe nuclear force constant increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nThe nuclear force constant increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{V}{N} = \\frac{1}{r_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{V}{N} = \\frac{Z\\alpha}{\\sqrt{A}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{V}{N} = \\frac{Z\\alpha}{\\sqrt{Z + N}}\n$$\nThe binding energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3} = 1$.\n\nThe nuclear force constant increases as $A^{1/3}/A^{1/3}", "\\begin{blockquote}\nIf you made a nuclear bomb using a heavier element, would it be more powerful by volume compared to hydrogen, helium, or uranium nuclear weapon? What element would yield the biggest result?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nThe basic idea behind a nuclear bomb is that you're trying to get a whole bunch of atoms to fuse together at once, which releases massive amounts of energy. The issue is that the lighter the atom, the easier it is to get it to fuse.\n\nThe reason the Hydrogen bomb is so powerful is because if you get two hydrogen atoms to fuse together, you get a helium nucleus + two protons. Since the protons have the same charges, they repel each other, and thus you need a lot of energy to get them to fuse. But the fusion of a hydrogen + hydrogen pair releases 24 MeV of energy, which is a whole lot.\n\nTo make heavy atoms fuse together, you need to get a whole bunch of them to fuse at once. If you try to get helium to fuse, you need to get two helium atoms together, then you get a beryllium nucleus + two alpha particles. But it's really hard to get two alpha particles to fuse, because they have the same charge as protons, and thus the same problem of repulsion.\n\nBut if you get four helium atoms together, you get an oxygen nucleus and two alpha particles. Oxygen has a net charge of 8-, so it's easier to get several of them to fuse together. And the fusion of four helium atoms releases 64 MeV of energy, which is a lot.\n\nIf you look at the fusion reactions of all the elements, you'll notice that the more massive the nucleus is, the easier it is to get a lot of them to fuse together. The problem is that as you go up the periodic table, the nucleus gets bigger and bigger, so it's harder to get them all into a small enough space that the repulsion doesn't overcome the fusion.\n\nBut you can get a lot of oxygen atoms to fuse, because they can fit into a pretty small space. Thus, if you can somehow get a bunch of oxygen atoms to fuse, you could get a massive amount of energy.\n\nHowever, oxygen is also a pretty massive element, and the more massive an atom (or nucleus) is, the harder it is to get them to move. So the biggest problem with making a bomb out of oxygen is that it's harder to get them to move.\n\nThis is why it's not feasible to make a bomb out of oxygen, and why it has to be hydrogen. The fusion of hydrogen is much easier, and it's much easier to get hydrogen to move.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. I have another question. If you made a nuclear bomb using a heavier element, would it be more powerful by volume compared to hydrogen, helium, or uranium nuclear weapon? What element would yield the biggest result?\n\nComment: @Nathan I've updated my answer.\n\nComment: Thank you. I have another question. Why is it that the more massive the nucleus is, the easier it is to get a lot of them to fuse together? I am sorry for asking so many questions.\n\nComment: @Nathan The more massive the nucleus is, the closer together the nucleons are, so it's easier to get them to fuse.\n\nComment: Thank you. I have another question. What are the benefits of fusing two atoms together? Is it simply that it releases a whole lot of energy?\n\nComment: @Nathan It's not just that it releases a whole lot of energy, but that it releases the energy by making a heavier nucleus. In principle, you could make a hydrogen bomb out of uranium, but it wouldn't be as big of a bomb, because it's harder to get the uranium atoms to fuse.\n\nComment: Thank you. I have another question. What is the principle of a hydrogen bomb?\n\nComment: @Nathan The basic idea is that you try to make a fusion explosion with the smallest possible amount of fuel, to get the most energy out of it.\n\nComment: Thank you for your answer. I have another question. Suppose that you created a bomb made out of oxygen, and that it was the same size as a hydrogen bomb. Would the oxygen bomb be more powerful or less", "I don't know that anyone has ever made a nuclear bomb using a heavier element, or if there is a practical way to do so.\n\nIf you used the same amount of material, you would get less explosive power.\n\nThe reason is that the amount of binding energy you can get out of fusing together a nucleus depends on the binding energy of the nucleus and the volume of the nucleus.\n\nThe heaviest nuclei are the heaviest elements. This means that those elements have the lowest binding energy per nucleon (per particle inside the nucleus). This is because the nucleons have to repel each other more strongly in order to keep the nucleus together.\n\nYou can get a sense of this using the [binding energy curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy_curve).  The binding energy per nucleon peaks at iron, and then it drops to about half of what it was for iron.\n\nSo, for example, a uranium nucleus has half the binding energy per nucleon as an iron nucleus, which means you can only get half as much energy out of fused uranium nuclei as you can out of fused iron nuclei.\n\nThis is why you can't get net energy out of fusing lighter nuclei together.\n\nComment: I had an argument with someone about this point. They said that if you had a hydrogen bomb, and a uranium bomb, the hydrogen bomb would be more explosive because it would occupy less space for the same amount of energy than the uranium bomb. I understand why this is not true, but I don't understand why.\n\nComment: I edited your answer a bit, but I'm not sure it's correct. There are two ways to get net energy out of fusing lighter nuclei. One is to use a heavier element. The other is to use a lighter element in a smaller quantity (i.e. a super-critical mass).\n\nComment: @Terry: I was talking about the usual way that nuclear weapons work. I'm sure there are exotic ways to get net energy out of fusing lighter nuclei, but I've never heard of those.\n\nComment: @Terry: What I said is still correct. For one thing, it's not obvious that you could get enough matter together for the reaction to go super-critical. But more importantly, the binding energy of the nuclei is very low compared to the energy you need to get them to fuse. So you would have to have so much material for the reaction to be super-critical that you are getting negligible energy out of fusing nuclei together.\n\nAnswer: Nuclear weapons use the energy released when nuclei of elements fuse together to create heavier elements. The energy released is the difference between the mass of the two nuclei before the fusion and the mass of the elements after the fusion.\n\nThis energy is released in the form of radiation, heat and kinetic energy.\n\nThis energy is used to heat the uranium or plutonium to a temperature high enough to cause it to fission. This is the primary energy source that causes the explosion.\n\nThe binding energy per nucleon of the products of the fusion reaction is lower than the binding energy per nucleon of the reactants. This means that the fission products are lighter than the reactant elements. The lighter elements are easier to fission. The fission of the lighter elements gives off more energy than the fusion of the heavy elements.\n\nSo the answer to your question is that the bigger the element used the bigger the explosion, but the more difficult it will be to fission the products.\n\nComment: AFAIK, the fission products are NOT lighter than the reactant elements.  The reactant elements are lighter than the fission products.  The fission products, however, are *heavier* than the products of the fusion reaction.  IOW, the fission products have higher binding energy per nucleon than the fission products of the fusion reaction.  Thus, the fission products will be easier to fission than the fusion products.\n\nComment: @DavidHammen, I see what you are saying. I've made a change to the answer.\n\nAnswer: What you are talking about is the difference between the binding energy of the fission products and the binding energy of the fusion products.\n\nIn fact, the fusion products are almost certainly heavier than the fission products because the fission products have a higher binding energy per nucleon.", "A bomb is an explosive, and explosives have energy \\em{per gram}.\n\n\\strong{If} you can make a nuclear bomb out of a heavier element, it will be far more powerful per gram.\n\nThe energy of an explosion is given by:\n\n$$E = mc^2 \\Delta v$$\n\nWhere $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nNow, if you made a bomb out of a heavier element, the mass of an explosive would be much greater.  This means the energy of the explosion would be mass times the speed of light times the change in velocity.\n\nIf the change in velocity is the same, then the energy is proportional to the mass.  Which means that the heavier the explosive, the more energy it will release.\n\nComment: So the answer is that if you could make a nuclear bomb using a heavier element, it would be much more powerful than the same amount of fissile material."]}

Why is the charge density of an electron different from the charge density of a quark?\n\nComment: @Dario The charge density of an electron is different from the charge density of a quark because the electron is different from the quark.", "The answer lies in the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation) for the electron, which is the relativistic version of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The Dirac equation is a \\em{linear} system, with the right-hand side being a linear combination of the (left-hand side) field operators. A \\em{linear} system can be solved by a \\em{basis} of eigenstates, in this case eigenstates of the relativistic Hamiltonian.\n\nFor a system of nonrelativistic particles, the Hamiltonian is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. The kinetic energy is linear in the position operators, and the potential energy is nonlinear. Since the system is linear in position, a basis of eigenstates of the kinetic energy is sufficient to represent the system.\n\nFor a relativistic particle, the Hamiltonian is the sum of the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy. The relativistic kinetic energy is a \\em{linear} combination of the four-momentum operators, and the potential energy is nonlinear. Since the system is linear in momentum, a basis of eigenstates of the relativistic kinetic energy is sufficient to represent the system.\n\nThe eigenstates of the relativistic kinetic energy are the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation) eigenstates. These are the \\em{spinors} that you see in the equations of motion.\n\nComment: I can't comment, but: The kinetic energy operator of a free particle is linear in position, $p^{2} / 2m = m \\dot{x}^{2} / 2 = x^{2} \\ddot{x} / 2$ (with $x = x(t)$ denoting the position at time $t$). For a particle in a potential, the kinetic energy operator is linear also in *potential* energy, $p^{2} / 2m = \\dot{x}^{2} / 2 + V(x) = x^{2} \\ddot{x} / 2 + V(x)$ (where we have defined $V(x) = V(x(t))$). The potential itself is nonlinear in position.\n\nComment: @Qmechanic: Yes, you're right. I've edited a little to be more clear, but essentially a linear system can be represented by a basis of eigenstates, and a linear system in the momentum is a linear system in *kinetic* energy, and the basis states are the Dirac equation eigenstates.\n\nComment: I think you mean \"nonrelativistic Hamiltonian\" and \"relativistic Hamiltonian\".\n\nComment: @user12262: Thanks, yes, that makes sense.", "The word \"structure\" in this context means \"mass\" or \"mass-energy\". Particles have mass and so they interact with other particles by exchanging mass-energy. So they have a structure.\n\nComment: This is the best answer. Particles are not structureless. They are \"massive\" as the word suggests.\n\nComment: @jjc385: I think that \"having structure\" might mean something different to a layman. It would be better to use different words, like \"they have mass and so they are massive\"\n\nComment: @Alessandro I totally agree.\n\nAnswer: \"Structureless\" is just a technical term, it means that they do not have a structure of quarks and other subatomic particles.\n\nThe technical term for \"quarks and other subatomic particles\" is \"hadrons\" (and \"quarks\" is a subclass of hadrons).\n\nSo \"structureless\" means \"not a hadron\".\n\nAnswer: It means that they are not made up of smaller particles (i.e. quarks and gluons make up protons and neutrons, and electrons are made up of point-like particles).\n\nAnswer: Structureless means that they are not made up of smaller particles.\n\n\\strong{Example:}\n\nProton is made up of quarks(up and down quarks).\n\nElectron is not made up of smaller particles.\n\nTherefore, electron is structureless.\n\nAnswer: The word \"structureless\" is a technical term. It means that they don't have structure. By structure, I mean the structure of quarks and other subatomic particles.\n\nThe technical term for quarks and other subatomic particles is \"hadrons\" (and quarks is a subset of hadrons).\n\nSo \"structureless\" means \"not a hadron\".", "\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nwhy are elementary particles structureless?\n\n  </blockquote>\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI assume you mean why are they not made of smaller particles?\n\nWell, they are. The quarks and the Higgs boson (if you count that as a particle).\n\nOf course, the Higgs boson is very short lived, and we can't measure it in everyday experiments."]}
{"prompt": "Do Childless people have higher or lower rates of depression and other mental illness?", "response_list": ["I was unable to find any data on childlessness and mental health.  There is a large literature on children and mental health, but I wasn't able to find any studies that looked at people who do not have children.\n\nThe only thing I have been able to find is this [article](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201102/childless-not-mentally-ill) which talks about the mental health of childless people.  It talks about what is called \"childless stigma\" and is a nice overview of the topic.\n\n[Wikipedia also has a page on the topic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childlessness), which includes a reference to a study that may be of interest.  The study is:\n\nHart, R. A., Davis, K. D., & Hines, D. A. (2003). Depression in childless and parenting adults. Journal of Health and Social Behavior, 44(3), 302-317.\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer. I found a study that was published in 2003 that looked at the mental health of childless people. I'll add that link to my question.\n\nAnswer: There are a few sources on the web which discuss the issue, but they are usually just opinion pieces.  These are the ones I found:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item [Is being childless a mental illness?](http://www.slate.com/id/2143280/)\n\\item [Childless and happy](http://www.smh.com.au/news/health/childless-and-happy/2005/08/19/1124459326658.html)\n\\item [Childless, Not Mentally Ill](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-squeaky-wheel/201102/childless-not-mentally-ill)\n\\item [Depression in the Childless](http://www.childlessbymarriage.net/2011/03/depression-in-the-childless.html)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThese opinion pieces seem to suggest that childlessness is not a \\em{cause} of depression, but that the two are unrelated.", "It's hard to get good data on this. The research on adults suggests that a person's children can be a moderately strong predictor of a person's well-being, but there are a lot of confounds. If you're depressed, are you less likely to have, or more likely to have, children? If you're poor, are you less likely to have, or more likely to have, children?\n\nThere are also a number of methodological difficulties, which I describe in [this blog post](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/daylightatheism/2013/03/do-childless-people-have-higher-or-lower-rates-of-depression-and-other-mental-illness/).\n\nComment: Interesting, I'd like to read more about this. Thanks.\n\nComment: @user1378695: I added a link.\n\nComment: I read your article, and I think it can be summarized as \"We can't tell if the correlation between childlessness and depression is caused by the former causing the latter, or by the latter causing the former, or by both. The former is more likely than the latter, though.\"\n\nComment: @user1378695: Yes, which is why I didn't give a definitive answer. (I also say that the data on adults is weak, which is why I said that the same would be true for children.)\n\nComment: I'm childless by choice. I'm not depressed. It's not difficult to find a bunch of childless people who aren't depressed.\n\nAnswer: There are no studies that I could find that address this issue directly. But there are studies that can be used to suggest an answer to your question.\n\nChildren are expensive. They are expensive to feed, expensive to clothe, expensive to entertain, expensive to educate, expensive to care for when they are sick, and expensive to insure. And they are expensive to have in the house. Insurance companies charge higher premiums to people with children. And homeowners insurance charges higher premiums to people who have teenage children.\n\nIf children are expensive, then people who cannot afford children are less likely to have children. And if people who cannot afford children are less likely to have children, then one would expect them to have lower rates of depression. So I think that there is a good chance that the answer to your question is \"yes\".\n\nComment: Children are expensive, but they also bring joy and happiness.  I think the only way to be sure is to study all people without regard to whether they have children.  Since the research is expensive, not many people are going to do it.\n\nComment: @user1378695 - I agree.  I just did the best I could with the data that is available.", "Childlessness is associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety, but it is not clear whether the association is causal or whether there are other factors involved, such as infertility or relationship breakdown.\n\nThe majority of the literature is based on studies that compare women with and without children, and the results have been mixed. Some studies have found that women without children are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, while others have found no difference.\n\nThe majority of the research has focused on women, but studies that have compared men with and without children have also found that men without children are more likely to experience depression and anxiety.\n\nThe evidence is not clear enough to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between childlessness and mental illness. It is possible that the relationship is causal, but it is also possible that there are other factors involved, such as infertility or relationship breakdown.\n\n\\strong{The question} \"Do childless people have higher or lower rates of depression and other mental illness?\" cannot be answered unequivocally, as the evidence is not clear enough to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between childlessness and mental illness.\n\nComment: I've edited the question to make it clearer. I'm not asking specifically about women, but if you have a specific answer to the question, you're welcome to edit it in.\n\nComment: @GrahamChiu: I have edited the answer to include studies that have compared men with and without children.\n\nComment: @GrahamChiu: I have also edited the answer to include studies that have compared men with and without children.\n\nComment: @GrahamChiu: I have also edited the answer to include studies that have compared men with and without children.", "I was surprised to find quite a number of studies on this topic.\n\nA 2012 study in [PLoS One](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23348540) of over 11,000 adults in the US found that childlessness was associated with a significantly higher risk of depression, anxiety and other mental illness.\n\nA 2010 study of nearly 8000 adults in the US (again) found that childless women had a higher risk of depression than women with children but that childless men had a lower risk of depression than men with children. The authors suggest that having children may increase feelings of insecurity and vulnerability in women.\n\nA 2006 study of over 31,000 people in the Netherlands found that childlessness was not associated with depression.\n\nA 2005 study in \\em{Depression and Anxiety} of 4760 adults in the US found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms.\n\nA 1992 study in \\em{Psychological Medicine} of over 8000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and stress.\n\nA 1989 study in \\em{The British Journal of Psychiatry} of almost 10,000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression but not stress.\n\nA 1989 study in \\em{Psychological Medicine} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1984 study in \\em{Social Psychiatry} of just under 2000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of anxiety and depression.\n\nA 1978 study in \\em{British Journal of Psychiatry} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1972 study in \\em{Psychological Medicine} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1967 study in \\em{British Journal of Psychiatry} of over 2000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1966 study in \\em{British Journal of Psychiatry} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1965 study in \\em{Social Psychiatry} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1964 study in \\em{British Journal of Psychiatry} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nA 1958 study in \\em{British Journal of Psychiatry} of over 1000 adults in the UK found that childlessness was associated with a higher risk of depression.\n\nSo, on the basis of just these studies, it looks as if childless people are more likely to be depressed and anxious than people with children \\em{in both the US and the UK}.\n\nHowever, the studies are also quite old (with the most recent dating from 2006), and the sample sizes are small compared to the studies conducted in the US. Also, there is no evidence regarding childless people in other countries, and there is no evidence about the effects of childlessness on people who are not already depressed.\n\nComment: The 1958 study is not clear about the sample size and seems to be based on the authors' own personal observations. The 1967 study is flawed because it lumps childless people with people who have children but lost them at a young age (which is different from not having children). The 1965 study only reports one sample. I'm not sure about the rest.\n\nComment", "The short answer is that there are no peer reviewed studies to answer this question.\n\nThere are a number of papers that have looked at the mental health of people who were infertile. One of them, from 2005, claims to show that people who are infertile are more likely to have been diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder. However they didn't actually measure whether or not the participants were infertile, they simply asked them if they had been diagnosed.\n\nAnother study from 2009 claimed that infertility was associated with higher rates of depression. However, this study simply looked at a number of studies on a given topic and concluded that the studies in question were all of poor quality.\n\nThere are a number of papers that look at how people cope with infertility. One of them found that people who are infertile are more likely to have a poorer mental health-related quality of life. However, the study only looked at a very small number of people, and the results may not generalize well to the wider population.\n\nThere is some evidence that suggests that people who are infertile may have a higher risk of developing depression than those who are fertile. However, this evidence is not definitive, and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nComment: Are you able to find any good quality studies? Or are you able to contact someone who could find such?\n\nComment: @DavidG, I can't find any good quality studies. I've contacted some researchers in this area and they haven't been able to find any studies either.\n\nComment: @DavidG, I'm not sure what you mean by a good quality study. All I was able to find were studies that had looked at the mental health of infertile people, and a few that had looked at the mental health of people with fertility problems.\n\nComment: I meant a study that asked the question (do childless people have higher or lower rates of depression and other mental illness). It appears from your answer that there isn't a study which actually asks that question.\n\nComment: @DavidG, my answer is that I can't find any studies that ask that question. I'm not sure what else you want me to say.\n\nComment: What I want to know is if you are able to find such a study, or if you are able to contact someone who could find such a study.\n\nComment: @DavidG, I'm not sure what you mean by \"such a study\". I've already found the papers that look at this topic, and I've already explained what they say. I'm not sure what more I can do.\n\nComment: I am asking if you can find a good quality study that asks the question.\n\nComment: @DavidG, I already said that I can't find such a study. I've already looked.\n\nComment: I suppose this question will have to be closed.\n\nAnswer: There are some studies that look at the mental health of childless people, but none that I am aware of that specifically look at depression or other mental illness.\n\nOne study found that childless people are more likely to have lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Another study found that childless people are more likely to have higher levels of anxiety and worry.\n\nThere are also some studies that look at the mental health of people who are infertile, but again none that I am aware of that specifically look at depression or other mental illness. These studies also found that people who are infertile are more likely to have lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction, and higher levels of anxiety and worry.\n\nOverall, the evidence seems to suggest that childless people are more likely to have lower levels of mental health than people who have children.\n\nComment: Are you able to find any good quality studies?

Sometimes, though, it leads to mistakes when I try to do too much too quickly.\"\n\nOne thing I've learned is that, in most cases, it's better to say what your weakness is, and then tell them how you're working to improve it.  That way, you're not just saying that you're weak at something, but you're showing them that you're actively working to improve yourself.\n\nI wouldn't recommend saying something like \"I can be a bit of a procrastinator\" or \"Sometimes I take on more than I can handle\".

I've had many interviewers tell me that my weakness of \"I'm perfectionist\" was a strength.  Don't tell them you can't deal with pressure, that you are a procrastinator, that you are afraid of change, etc.  Those are all weaknesses.  Your weakness should be that you are too hard on yourself, or that you are too much of a perfectionist.\n\nComment: I think the best answer, and it's true, is to say that you are a perfectionist.  That is a weakness, because you will sometimes be too hard on yourself, but it is also a strength, because you will always strive for perfection.\n\nComment: \"I'm a bit of a perfectionist\" is a weak answer.  They are asking about your weaknesses, not qualities you like about yourself.  Don't answer with a strength, answer with a weakness.\n\nComment: I've been asked this question about 100 times in my professional career, and I have never once seen it used as a negative.  It's always been a positive.  If you say you are a perfectionist, you are showing that you are hard working and that you have high standards.  If you say you are a perfectionist, and then say that you are very hard on yourself, you are saying that you are a hard worker.  If you say you are a perfectionist, and say that it is a weakness because you beat yourself up when you make a mistake, you are showing that you are self critical and will do whatever it takes to succeed.\n\nComment: I disagree with the idea that this is a tough question, and I disagree with the idea that you can't be honest.  I agree that you should only give one weakness, but there is no reason why you can't be honest when you do it.  I also disagree with the idea that you should only say positive things about yourself.  If you are asked what your weakness is, you should be honest.  If you are asked what you dislike about yourself, that's a different question.

It's not a \"weakness.\"  It's a fact.  A slow learner is a \"negative\" in that it would be a negative trait to have in a job where you're constantly having to learn new things.  But it's not a weakness.  A weakness is a fault in character or personality that causes you to be a bad employee.  A slow learner isn't that.\n\nComment: I agree with John.  This is not a weakness.  It's a fact, and a fact that will make it difficult for you to get the job.  A weakness would be something like \"I'm a perfectionist\" or \"I can't work alone\" or \"I'm not good at delegating tasks\".  Any of those would be a weakness, which makes it difficult for you to work as a team or with a manager, and therefore difficult to actually *get* the job and keep it.\n\nComment: +1 to both the comments above.  What's your biggest weakness should be something that would *actually* cost you the job.  Not something that a lot of people have and that would be difficult to fix.  The question isn't \"what's your biggest weakness?\"  It's \"what's your biggest weakness that would make it hard for you to do this job?\"  No one is going to say \"My biggest weakness is that I'm a slow learner\" because that's a trait that's common to most of the population and would be hard to get around.\n\nComment: I think this is a good answer, if not the perfect one.  \"I am a slow learner\" is a factual weakness, not a personality trait.  A quick learner might get a job done in 4 hours, while it takes the slow learner 6.  I wouldn't say that this is a weakness, either, unless it was something that really interfered with the job at hand.  For instance, if you were applying for a job that required you to be able to memorize and process a lot of information, and you were slow at that, I'd say that's a weakness.\n\nComment: You could also expand on the \"I can be a bit of a perfectionist\" suggestion.  \"I can tend to get in my own way sometimes as a result of my perfectionism.  I'm working on it though, and I think I've become better about it.\"", "\\section{Don't be too self-critical.}\n\nHonesty is good.

Microsoft is trying to create touch and gesture based interfaces when it is obvious that touch and gesture based interfaces are much more suited to mobile devices than desktop devices.\n\nMicrosoft's history with touch based interfaces has been that users hate it. A long time ago, Microsoft created the Tablet PC, which was a computer that used a touch screen. Microsoft promoted it as the future of computing. But the Tablet PC was a complete failure.

I can't say what a current product will ultimately fail. But I can give you examples of products that failed. The most prominent example of such a failure is the [Ford Edsel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Edsel).\n\nThe Ford Edsel is one of the most famous commercial failures. It was a car which failed in the market. It came with an extensive advertising campaign, which failed, too. It costed Ford US$350 million dollars.\n\nFord's CEO at that time was Henry Ford II. He was the grandson of Henry Ford (of the Ford Motor Company). This is why the car was named after the Edsel Ford, Henry Ford II's father.\n\nThe Ford Edsel was introduced in 1957. It was discontinued in 1960.\n\nComment: I think you might be confusing the Edsel with the Pinto.\n\nComment: @KenWhite: No, I'm not.\n\nComment: Then you should be more specific that the Edsel failed _in the market_ and _the advertising campaign_ failed. As of now, it's just a nebulous sentence.\n\nComment: @KenWhite: Do you believe that the advertising campaign for the Ford Edsel failed? I think that it did.\n\nComment: Not necessarily. But your statement as is is open to interpretation.\n\nComment: @KenWhite: What is the definition of _advertising campaign_? Wikipedia says: \"Advertising campaign is a series of advertisement messages that share a single idea and theme which make up an integrated marketing communication (IMC)\". I think that the advertising campaign for the Ford Edsel did not share a single idea and theme.\n\nComment: You're right, but you should say that, not leave it open to interpretation. Also, I think the Pinto is the car that failed, not the Edsel, which is often cited as the most famous flop (and which I've mistakenly thought all this time to be the Pinto).\n\nComment: @KenWhite: I'm sorry, I do not follow you. What's your point?\n\nComment: The point is that the Edsel failed, but the Pinto is the car that often gets compared to it. The Pinto failed because of an issue with the gas tank, which could explode if hit by a rear-end collision.\n\nComment: @KenWhite: The Pinto was discontinued in 1980. The Ford Edsel was discontinued in 1960.\n\nComment: Yes, and the Edsel was an _early_ failure.\n\nAnswer: I am a Windows user and I think Windows 8 is a failure.\n\nComment: I have the same feelings about Windows 8.

If you get a job at a government agency, you can further your education by getting a Ph.D. on the side of your normal work.\n\nComment: Applied Physics is not a real field, its just a catch all for people who don't know what they want to do.  It has no real job opportunities.  If you really want to do physics, then get a PhD in physics.\n\nAnswer: I've been in industry for a long time, and a number of my colleagues have masters degrees from other fields.  The most common complaints I hear from them are that their courses were more theoretical than practical, and that they were not sufficiently prepared for the industrial environment.  To me, this suggests that they would have been better served by a degree in physics or engineering.\n\nAnswer: I'm a PhD student in applied physics and I am often asked by my friends and family where they can actually apply their physics degrees.

It seems to me that a masters in applied physics is a bit more general than a regular masters in physics.  Many students earn a masters degree in physics, then a PhD.  Applied physics could be a nice alternative to earning a PhD.\n\nAnswer: From a practical perspective, a Master's degree will help you get a job.  For example, a Master's degree in Applied Physics is very useful in a technical field like software engineering.  OTOH, it's not useful in a technical field like systems engineering / integration, for which you'd need to have a Master's degree in engineering.\n\nIn a field like physics, I think you can get away with a Bachelor's degree and a PhD, but many fields require a Master's degree.  For example, a Master's degree is pretty much a requirement to move into management in a technical field."]}

I suggest posting a separate question, with the title of the book and the date it was published.\n\nComment: @David Butterworth: I just did.\n\nAnswer: You can go to Google Scholar and see how much the book has been cited.  For example, if you search for \"intitle:book +author:author\" you will find the book on the first page of results.

Also, some fields have a very different citation culture than others.\n\nComment: @AlexDeLarge: I've sometimes intentionally omitted references in scientific papers because I felt they were out of date.

If this answer or any other one solved your issue, please mark it as accepted.\n\nAnswer: For a book to be widely used and well accepted by scholars, it has to be cited by scholars in their scholarly work. You can use Google Scholar to search for the book title, which will return articles that cite the book. If the book is cited by a lot of articles, it could be an indication that the book is widely used by scholars. However, this is not necessarily the case, as it's possible for a book to be cited by a small number of articles but be widely used.\n\nIn addition to Google Scholar, you can also check the website of the publisher of the book, as they may have information about the book's sales, reviews, and other indicators of its popularity. You can also check online bookstores and libraries to see if the book is available and if it has been reviewed by scholars.\n\nAnswer: Google Scholar is definitely the way to go. In addition to that, however, you can take a look at the references section of the book. It'll often be the case that a book that is widely used and well-accepted will have many other well-regarded scholars' works cited in the references section.\n\nAnswer: You can use Google Scholar to search for the title of the book, but you might also check the reference section of the book to see if it has been cited by other scholars in their own work.", "One way is to check if the book is indexed in a scholarly index such as Books in Print (BIP), [Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/), [EBSCO](http://www.ebscohost.com/), [Cambridge Scientific Abstracts](http://www.csa.com/), [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), [Web of Science](http://www.isinet.com/wos), etc. Also, Google Scholar and Web of Science can tell you how many times a book was cited.\n\nAnswer: I'd recommend checking the book's contents against the [list of publications](http://www.acm.org/publications/search) of the ACM, if the book is from the ACM Press. Otherwise, you can try a [Google Scholar search](http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22the+book+title%22&hl=en&as_publication=books&as_ylo=2000&as_yhi=2009&btnG=Search+Scholar) for the book title.\n\nAnswer: You could look at the [Web of Science](http://isinet.com/wos) for the book title.  This will show how often its been cited by others.  This is probably the best way to find out.\n\nComment: Google Scholar is also a good option.

To understand this, you must first understand what a hero is.\n\nThere are many definitions of a hero, but the definition that I think is most applicable to Superman is this:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nA hero is a person who is admired for their achievements and noble qualities, and who is regarded as a role model.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nIn this definition, the word \"achievements\" is the key word. The word \"achievements\" means accomplishments, and accomplishments are things that you have done. So when you have done something, and now you are admired and are regarded as a role model, then you are a hero.\n\nIn the very first Superman comic, Superman saves Lois Lane from a falling plane by lifting the plane off her. He did not put himself at risk, but he stopped the plane from hitting Lois. In other words, he accomplished something. And because of this accomplishment, he is now admired and regarded as a role model.\n\nIn this sense, it doesn't matter whether Superman puts himself at risk or not. What matters is that he accomplished something, and because of this accomplishment, he is now a hero.\n\nComment: I will accept your answer as the most complete answer.\n\nAnswer: \\section{Superman is a Hero}\n\nThe definition of a hero is:\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\n\\strong{Hero}\n\n  \\em{noun}\n\n  A person, typically a man, who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.\n\n  \\em{Oxford Dictionary}\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nWhat makes a person a hero is not that they put themselves in danger to save people but rather that they save people.\n\nSuperman is a hero because he saves people.\n\nComment: This is a good answer, but I wish you could elaborate on why they are heroes? Do you have any sources to back it up?\n\nComment: @Trufa I'd argue the first and third sentences are not true. A hero is not a person who is admired or idealized for outstanding achievements - a hero can be one who fails, but is still admired and idealized for noble qualities. And the definition uses the word \"typically\" - which means that it is not necessarily true that a hero is a man who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.\n\nComment: @AwalGarg I was being too literal in my choice of words. I've updated what I said to account for the fact that a hero does not need to save people to be a hero.\n\nComment: @Trufa I was simply saying that 'a hero is not necessarily a person who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities' since the dictionary uses the word 'typically'.\n\nComment: @AwalGarg I understand that. That is why I updated what I said about a hero being someone who saves people.\n\nComment: @Trufa I think this is a good answer, and you've done a good job of supporting it, but I feel that the definition of a hero is more of a personal choice, and varies by culture.\n\nComment: @JasonBaker Yes, the definition of a hero is personal. I was just using the definition that I found on the Oxford Dictionary that I thought would be most appropriate for this question.\n\nAnswer: The definition of a hero is someone who does something great, or saves someone's life.

A hero does not need to put himself in danger or in a battle for his own life.\n\nComment: @Trufa What sources do you need?\n\nComment: I was asking for sources on why Superman is a hero.\n\nAnswer: I think it is definitely fair to call Superman a hero. Here is why:\n\nIn the original Superman comic, he saves a plane from crashing into a building (this is my only example, but it is my best). I think that Superman is a hero because he saved the plane from crashing into the building. He did not need to risk his life to do this. He did not", "This has been discussed in the [Superman's Virtues](http://www.dcuguide.com/reading_list.php?id=2038) storyline, which was written by Grant Morrison.\n\nThe basic premise is that Superman is not a hero because he never risks himself. He is a hero because he risks himself all the time. There have been many times when Superman has put himself in danger to save others.", "You said it: \"99% of the time\".\n\nAs we all know, Superman often does put himself at risk (sending him to the hospital, or even to his grave). He just doesn't do it \\em{all} the time.\n\nThat's life. In real life, we all take risks, most of the time just to get from the house to the office in the morning. We all take risks, and most of the time we're fine. But sometimes we're not fine, and sometimes it's because of the risks we took.\n\nSo this is not a special case of Superman at all. The question is whether it's fair to call \\em{anyone} a hero when they take risks most of the time but get away with it.\n\nIn my opinion, the answer is \"Yes, it is fair\". The term \"hero\" is not reserved for those who always take risks. If that were the case, there would be no heroes in the world.\n\nAs long as they take risks most of the time, I think it's fair to call them heroes.\n\nAnswer: Yes, I think it is fair to call Superman a hero.\n\nA hero is someone who puts others before themselves for the benefit of all.  Yes, the risks are there for Superman, but he is still saving people, and that would be considered a heroic act.\n\nComment: It is also fair to call Batman a hero.  But the question is more valid for Superman than Batman.  Batman puts himself at risk all the time.\n\nAnswer: It's fair to call Superman a hero, and 99% of the time he does put himself at risk.  If he didn't, he would be a pretty lousy hero.  But the other 1% of the time, he can't be taking risks because he has to do something else, which is a good thing.\n\nComment: \"1%\" is a massive overestimate, but on the other hand, I can accept some of the \"1%\" as being times when he is not sure if his intervention is really needed, so he waits until he is sure before deciding to act.\n\nComment: @dimo414: I think you're right.  I'm sure he does risk himself 99% of the time.  But I just wanted to point out that the other 1% is not really 0%.\n\nAnswer: That 99% of the time he puts himself at no risk is what makes him a hero. He's not a hero if he put himself at risk every time. The point is that he puts himself at risk enough that he could die, but he doesn't. By your definition, every soldier who goes to war is not a hero.\n\nComment: \"The point is that he puts himself at risk enough that he could die, but he doesn't.\"  That's not a hero.  That's a lucky person.\n\nComment: @dimo414: a hero is someone who risks his life a lot, but survives.\n\nComment: This is not correct.  A hero is someone who risks his life, but always survives.\n\nComment: @dimo414: Then Superman is not a hero. He's just lucky.\n\nComment: @dimo414: a hero is just someone who risks his life, but survives.\n\nComment: @dimo414: a \"hero\" is someone who risks his life and survives.  The fact that he survives is what makes him a hero.  The fact that he survives 99% of the time is what makes him a good hero.\n\nComment: @dimo414: a hero is someone who risks his life, but survives.\n\nComment: @dimo414: a hero puts himself at risk, but survives.\n\nComment: @dimo414: A hero is someone who risks his life, but survives.

There are many explanations.  I\u2019m not sure any of them are best.\n\nAnyway, here\u2019s a couple of explanations.\n\nOne explanation is that Newton\u2019s laws are just a set of observations (called [laws of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_nature)) that Newton made about the way things worked.\n\nFor example, Newton observed that apples fell to the ground.  And he observed that if he threw an apple up in the air, it would come back down.  And he observed that if he threw an apple up in the air at the same time he threw an apple down at his feet, the apple that was thrown up in the air would come down at the same time as the apple that was thrown down at his feet.  And he observed that, if he threw the apple up to a greater height, it would take longer to come back down.  And he observed that, if he threw the apple faster, it would seem to come back down slower.\n\nSo, Newton said that an apple will fall to the ground with a constant acceleration, and that this acceleration was proportional to the gravitational constant, and that the gravitational constant was 32.2 feet per second per second.  If you\u2019re wondering what that number means, that\u2019s how high an apple will fall in 1 second if it\u2019s dropped from a height of 32.2 feet.\n\nAnd, he also observed that the apple continued to move at a constant speed after it hit the ground, and that this speed was proportional to the distance the apple traveled during the time it was falling to the ground.\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nWhat is the best explanation of Newton\u2019s laws?\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nAnother explanation is that Newton\u2019s laws are a model of how things work in the universe.  The best explanation of how a model works is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What are the assumptions that the model is based on?\n\\item What are the things that the model ignores or doesn\u2019t take into account?\n\\item What are the things the model explains?\n\\item What are the things the model doesn\u2019t explain?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor Newton\u2019s laws, one of the assumptions is that there are no other forces acting on an apple besides gravity.  Another assumption is that there are no other objects acting on an apple besides the ground.  Also, the model ignores air resistance.\n\nAnother explanation is that Newton\u2019s laws are an approximation of how things work in the universe.  And the best explanation of an approximation is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What is the full explanation of how things work?\n\\item What are the things that the approximation ignores or doesn\u2019t take into account?\n\\item What are the things that the approximation explains?\n\\item What are the things that the approximation doesn\u2019t explain?\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe full explanation of how things work is [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity).  And the approximation is that the gravitational force is proportional to the gravitational constant.", "A body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will remain in motion.

I will check out the Feynman lectures.\n\nAnswer: The [Sabine hedgehog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_hedgehog) is a good explanation.\n\nAnswer: I'd say the best explanation of Newton's laws is to show how they are derived from Noether's theorem. The derivation isn't too hard.\n\nNewton's laws can be derived from Noether's theorem. In the language of Noether's theorem, we have the principle of the least action, which states that in a Lagrangian system the action is stationary. Now, the Lagrangian in the Newtonian system is:\n\n$L = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2-mv_0x$\n\nThe action is:\n\n$S = \\int L dt$\n\nSo the action is stationary if:\n\n$\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\int L dt = 0$\n\nWe can solve for the velocity and we get:\n\n$0 = \\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{1}{2}mv^2-mv_0x = \\frac{d}{dt}mv^2 - mv_0x \\Rightarrow 0 = m\\frac{dv}{dt} - mv_0 \\Rightarrow \\frac{dv}{dt} = mv_0 \\Rightarrow v = v_0t$\n\nSo the velocity of the particle is a function of time.\n\nNow, using the principle of the least action we need to find the motion that will minimize the action. So the motion that will minimize the action is:\n\n$v = v_0t$\n\nNow, the acceleration:\n\n$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}v_0t = v_0$\n\nNow, using the principle of the least action we need to find the motion that will minimize the action. So the motion that will minimize the action is:\n\n$x = x_0t$\n\nSo the velocity of the particle is a function of time.\n\nNow, the acceleration:\n\n$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}v_0t = v_0$\n\nSo the acceleration is constant. This is Newton's 1st law.\n\nSo, the motion of the particle is not just a function of time, but also of the initial position and velocity:\n\n$x = x_0t, v = v_0t$\n\nSo the velocity of the particle is a function of time. The initial velocity is:\n\n$v_0 = \\frac{dx}{dt}|_{t=0}$\n\nNow, the acceleration:\n\n$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}v_0t = v_0$\n\nSo the acceleration is constant. This is Newton's 1st law.\n\nSo, the motion of the particle is not just a function of time, but also of the initial position and velocity:\n\n$x = x_0t, v = v_0t$\n\nSo the velocity of the particle is a function of time. The initial velocity is:\n\n$v_0 = \\frac{dx}{dt}|_{t=0}$\n\nNow, the acceleration:\n\n$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}v_0t = v_0$\n\nSo the acceleration is constant. This is Newton's 1st law.\n\nThis is why I would say that the best explanation of Newton", "Because Newton's laws are the most general and universal laws of motion possible.  They are laws of motion in all frames of reference, and the laws of motion of all inertial frames of reference are the same.  So they are the best.  The other laws of motion (like F=ma, which is the law of acceleration for a particle which is not accelerating but is being accelerated) are not the most general and universal laws of motion possible.\n\nComment: Thank you for the answer. This is probably the best way of explaining it. I think I was just overthinking it.", "I suppose that the best explanation is that Newton's laws are the true laws of physics.\n\nComment: I agree.  That's why I asked about the best explanation.  I guess I'm looking for a theory of why Newton's laws are the true laws of physics.  That's obviously not a question that can be answered in a short paragraph, but I'm hoping someone can point me in the direction of a useful explanation."]}

I'm looking at something like this 2013 Honda Civic.\n\nComment: @Brian If you're looking at a 2013 Civic, it's a great car.  It was redesigned in 2012, so it's not an old design, and it's a Honda.  I think it's a great choice.\n\nComment: That's it! Thanks for all the help!\n\nComment: @Brian I just want to be clear what you're asking.  You're saying that you're going to buy a 2013 Honda Civic with cash?  If so, you'll really enjoy the car.\n\nComment: You bet. It's my first car at 16, and it's going to be a great one!\n\nComment: @Brian I'm sure you'll love it.  Let us know how you like it.\n\nComment: @Brian I bought my first new car when I was 22, and I still remember how much I loved it.  I hope you do too.\n\nComment: @Brian You are going to enjoy it.\n\nComment: I'm taking it home tomorrow!\n\nComment: @Brian If you like this answer, you can \"accept\" it by clicking the checkmark next to it.\n\nAnswer: Make sure that you don't fall in love with the car, even if you're buying it with cash.  I once did this with my first car and ended up with a $1200 per month car loan.  And I had to take out a $2000 loan to pay for the car.  Ouch.  I was young and stupid.\n\nComment: I've been looking at the car for a while, but it's nice.\n\nComment: I agree with this - I think the best car for your first car is a used one.  The car you're going to buy is going to be your first car.  The second car may be a new car, or a used car, or another new car.  But this first one should be as cheap as possible.  So go to craigslist and find yourself a used car.  The insurance will be cheaper, the price will be cheaper, and you'll learn more from the experience.  Good luck!\n\nComment: @Brian I'm going to say that you've probably already bought the car.  But if you haven't, I hope you take this advice.  The car you're buying will be your first car, so it should be a used car.  It's OK to buy a used car when you're young.  But you'll learn a lot more if the car you buy is a used car.  Don't think that you're going to be driving this car for 10 years.  When you're 26, you'll want to buy your first new car.\n\nComment: I've gotten a lot of advice, and I don'", "\\strong{Never buy a car from a private seller} unless you are an expert at car mechanics.\n\n\\strong{Never buy a car from a dealer} unless you are an expert at negotiating.\n\n\\strong{Never buy a car from a dealer} unless you are an expert at test driving cars.\n\nSo, in summary: buy a new car from a dealer, and then negotiate the price down as much as possible.", "Make sure you are getting what you want.

My first car had a problem with the hood latch right out of the gate.  I just took it back to the dealer and they fixed it.\n\nIt's a good idea to get the extended warranty, because as a first time car buyer, you will have no clue what to do when the car breaks down.  My wife was an amazing car buyer, she was like a little pit bull with a bone.  She got them to throw in a bunch of stuff that they were trying to charge extra for.  She also got them to throw in a ton of extra warranties at no cost.\n\nBut I will say that the last few cars I've bought, I haven't gotten any of the extended warranties.  They are a rip off.  Just fix the damn thing when it breaks.  In fact, I've never paid for a warranty that the dealer sold me.  I've always just taken the car somewhere else and let them handle the warranty work.\n\nComment: But if the dealer is the one who sold it to me, won't they also be the one who honors the warranty?\n\nComment: Yeah, but you'll get a lot cheaper rates in a mechanic shop.  If you've got a warranty, don't get it fixed by the dealer, just take it somewhere else and let them take care of it.\n\nComment: If you're referring to the extended warranty, yes, I'm aware that I can get it fixed somewhere else. I'm referring to the standard manufacturer warranty.\n\nComment: I think you're referring to the \"factory warranty.\"  I've never had a dealer tell me that I couldn't take it somewhere else to get it fixed.  Just don't expect them to pay for it.\n\nAnswer: I think your question is actually twofold:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item What should I look for when buying a car?\n\\item How should I go about haggling with the dealer?\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Car Buying}\n\nDon't buy the first car you see. Look around and find the make and model you want.

Check out several car lots, and compare prices.\n\n\\strong{Haggling}\n\nDon't bother with the \"no haggling\" deals. They're a ripoff.\n\nDon't buy the first car you see from a single dealer. Check out several car lots, and compare prices.\n\nDon't be afraid to walk away. The car will still be there tomorrow. If they won't haggle with you on price, then they're not a good dealer.\n\nComment: For the first two questions, I've been doing all of that, just wanted to know if there was something I'm missing.", "\\em{It depends.}\n\nIf you buy a new car from a dealer or a private party, you should get a [Carfax report](http://www.carfax.com/) to see if the car has been in an accident.\n\nIf you buy a car from a dealer, you have a \"lemon law\" that protects you against fraud.  It may vary by state, but basically if you buy a defective car that is not repairable, you can return it for a refund.\n\nThe biggest risk of buying a used car is getting screwed.  If you are buying from a dealer, you should be protected, but private sales are a different matter.  You have no protection if you go into a deal with someone you don't know at all, and they could just take your money and drive away.\n\nThere are lots of other things to consider, but the most important for me is, \"Can I afford it?\"  If you are going to be upside down on the loan, you will have to make up the difference when you trade it in.  Also, when the car breaks, you will be upside down and not be able to afford the repairs.  So you may not want to buy a car that is more expensive than you can afford.\n\nComment: I would also like to add that you should make sure that you know the value of the car before you purchase it.  I bought a used car a while ago and thought I was getting a good deal.  I took it to a mechanic and he said that it had been involved in an accident and the repair had not been done correctly.  The dealer had no idea.\n\nComment: Also, if you are buying a used car from a dealer and you are going to finance it, be sure to get a loan from a different institution than the dealer is using.  The dealer will try to sell you an expensive loan, because they are making a lot of money off of it.  If you are buying a used car, the dealer is not going to make a lot of money on it, so they will push you towards a loan you cannot afford.\n\nComment: I recently bought a car from a dealer, and they let me test drive it for a weekend to make sure that I liked it.  If I had not been able to drive it, I would not have known if the car was for me or not, and I would have been stuck with a car that I didn't want...\n\nComment: What if I don't have the funds to buy a car?\n\nComment: @DeadMG If you don't have the funds to buy the car, you can't afford to buy it.\n\nComment: @Ryan - I'm not sure what you mean by \"upside down on the loan\".\n\nComment: @KendallFlinn If you buy a car for $10,000 and have a loan for $10,000, you are not upside down.  If you buy a car for $10,000 and have a loan for $12,000, you are upside down.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{itemize}\n\\item Make sure you get a CarFax report and/or have the car inspected by a mechanic.\n\\item If you are buying the car from a dealer and you are financing the car, do not go through the dealer. If you do, they will try to sell you a loan that has a high interest rate. You will end up paying thousands of dollars of interest, just because you are buying a used car.\n\\item Do not pay full price for your car. You should be able to negotiate. If the dealer will not negotiate, walk away.\n\\item If you are not familiar with the car you want to buy, make sure you test drive the car. This will give you a chance to see if the car is right for you, and if there is anything that you do not like about it.\n\\item If you are buying from a dealer, make sure that you have a warranty.\n\\item Do not buy a car that has been in an accident, unless it has been repaired properly. If you are buying from a dealer, you can get a CarFax report to see if the car has been in an accident.\n\\item If you are buying from a private party, do not buy a car that has been in an accident.\n\\item Do not buy a car that has been flooded"]}

This makes it easier for nationalists to find like-minded people and engage in conversations about nationalism. Additionally, social media allows nationalists to spread their message quickly and easily, reaching a larger audience than traditional forms of communication.\n\nAnswer: Nationalism and populism have been around for centuries, but the advent of social media and Twitter has enabled them to spread more quickly and easily. In the past, nationalists had to rely on print media or face-to-face communication to spread their ideas.

I would argue that nationalism is a concept of the modern world and not of the premodern world. And I would argue that nationalism is essentially a secular phenomenon. It is a phenomenon of the modern world that is essentially secular. As the world becomes secularised, as the world becomes modernised, nationalism becomes more and more important. And the more people become secularised, the more nationalism becomes important. If you look at the 1930s, it was very much a secular phenomenon because there was a secularisation process that was taking place at that time. And it was a time when nationalism became more and more important.

(This is required under federal law - Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m).)  As part of the investigation, the employer should interview witnesses and review evidence to try to determine whether sexual harassment was occurring.  If the investigation concludes that harassment was occurring, the employer must take action to stop it.\n\nSo it is likely that the employer was required to investigate your complaint about the supervisor, and that the investigator would have had to interview you as part of that process.  That is, in itself, not retaliation, and is a normal part of an investigation.\n\nThe second issue is whether the employer retaliated against you for filing the complaint.  Under federal law, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for filing a complaint.  If the investigation was conducted in a biased manner, or if the employer took adverse action against you (firing, demotion, reduction in hours, etc.) because you filed the complaint, that would be retaliation.\n\nIf you believe that you have been retaliated against, you should speak with an employment lawyer who can help you determine the appropriate action to take, and, if necessary, file a lawsuit against the employer.\n\nComment: This is a good answer and I would also recommend finding out the exact reason for the supervisor being fired. If it's because of the complaint, then the retaliation is likely done through the HR department. If the supervisor was fired for other reasons that are unrelated to the complaint, then the retaliation may be coming from them directly.", "It is illegal for him to contact you directly, but it is legal for him to contact your husband.

You have no idea if the supervisor was serious or just blowing off some steam.\n\nSecond, I suggest that you contact the EEOC and report the supervisor. It is not clear from your question if you worked for the city or a private company. If you worked for the city, the EEOC will forward your complaint to the city. If you worked for a private company, the EEOC will open an investigation. (You could also call your city attorney's office and have them file a complaint on your behalf.)\n\nThird, I suggest that you contact your lawyer and tell him what the supervisor did. Your lawyer can give you advice about what to do next.\n\nAnswer: The ex-supervisor's message is clearly a threat that could be prosecuted as a crime. If you are in the United States, file a police report. If you are not, file a police report in whatever country you are in and contact a local lawyer to determine whether there is a legal remedy for you. The threat could be prosecuted as a criminal offense in the US, and it is probably criminal behavior in other countries too.\n\nComment: I suggest the OP contact a lawyer before filing a police report. Although the ex-supervisor's message suggests that he intends to personally harm the OP, the OP should be cautious about making an accusation that could be seen as a false accusation. It's better to have a lawyer advise the OP about how to proceed.\n\nComment: @NickC That's a very good point. I'll edit my answer to reflect this.", "It is entirely possible that the supervisor was fired for reasons not related to the complaint you filed.  For example, he may have been fired for insubordination or for misconduct.  Unless you are privy to the actual reasons the supervisor was fired, you cannot assume that it was because of the complaint you filed against him.\n\nThat being said, if you are concerned about this, you may consider filing a complaint with the EEO.  If you do so, you should consider consulting with an employment lawyer before you file."]}
